            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Readers.</head>
            <p>I Shall only detain you ſo long as to tell you a few things that concern the Motives to this Work, and the Author of it. For the former, take it from me (who know better than any body elſe) they are none but the Authors love to Truth and Peace; and his Charity to well-meaning and abuſed people. Think what you pleaſe; I am ſure he is not naturally ſowre or quarrelſome, much leſs angry with any man meerly becauſe he differs from him. He hath not been exaſperated by contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor put out of humour by fierce diſputings; for he hath no Difference with any man living; he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loves Diviſions, nor lives by them. He hath as much reſpect alſo and regard as he deſires: ſo much as may ſecure him from the temptation of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying, and the mean arts of ſeeking to gain a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to himſelf by diſparaging other men. As for hopes of preferment, which ſome have ſaid are his end, beſides that he ſtudiouſly conceals himſelf, I declare, that if he were capable or deſirous of it, he would not be at ſo much pains to ſeek it. And as he ſeeks not to gain any worldly thing hereafter by his writing, ſo he loſes nothing at preſent by that
<pb facs="tcp:63803:3"/>which he writes againſt. For neither he, nor any of his friends (that he knows of) receive the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice by any mans Non-conformity, or ſeparated Meetings; and ſo he ſhould not have taken any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, if Religion had not been concern'd. But he is very ſenſible that this ſuffers very much; and that which many Miniſters who keep ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Aſſemblies, cannot condemn, is condemned, nay deſpiſed, by thoſe that follow them. For there is undoubted evidence that their not coming to the Common prayers, and not declaring plainly the true reaſon of it, makes many ſtand aloof of, and abhor our Service, as if it were the <hi>Maſs.</hi> The people are ſeldom at leiſure to examine the Reaſon of things, nor apt to put themſelves upon that work without much urging: but they are alwayes ready to follow-the example of thoſe whom they admire, and the leſs they know why, the more forward they are to out-do the Copy they chuſe to imitate. So that the Miniſters not doing what they can in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the eſtabliſh'd order, and not declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſincerely the cauſes why they do not, is interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a farther abhorence, than they (if they durſt ſpeak out) are willing to own. When they do but ſignifie their diſguſt, and that their pallate is not pleaſed; their followers are nauſeated preſently, and their ſtomacks turn'd. If they make an halt, or a ſtep back; thoſe get the bit between their teeth: they kick and fling and run away. Now though this bogling and ſtarting may be lookt upon by many cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
<pb facs="tcp:63803:3"/>and well-meaning people, as the effect of a commendable caution, or a quick ſenſe or percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an approaching miſchief, and of an exacter difference they make between good and evil, than others do; yet experience tells us the contrary, that the more ordinary cauſe is defect of eye-ſight and confuſed apprehenſions of things, Ignorance and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, if not reſtiveneſs and Jadiſh tricks. For to give but one palpable inſtance of this among many; have you not obſerved at the funeral of a Friend when a Sermon has been preacht, how a part of the company, as ſoon as they come toward the Church door, preſently draw off and ſeparate from the reſt, as if they were going about ſome Idolatrous ſervice? Would not a ſtranger think that ſome noiſome and offenſive vapour or ſtifling ſmoak aſcended from our Devotions, which made theſe men ſo ſhie to enter, till by the ſinging of a <hi>Pſalm</hi> they had notice given that the air was clear and fit to breath in, and then it may be they came in? But where lyes the offence all this while, if we may be worthy to underſtand it? Is it in the white garment wherein the Miniſter officiates? But why, I pray, is this more troubleſome (unleſs to the tricks I ſpoke of) than a black one? There is nothing frightful ſure in three ſentences of Scripture, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Pſalm</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> or a leſſon of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and yet this is all, ſave the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> at the end of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which one would think might eſcape with fair quarter, eſpecially now that their purſuit ſeems to be ſo hot after the freſh game of <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:63803:4"/>I know there are ſome ſober perſons who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from us, that are not thus skittiſh; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them humble, modeſt and not cenſorious, I not only love but honour them with all my heart. There are others alſo, who from the womb have been taught to ſtart aſide and to abhor our ſervice; and being unable to reaſon and uncapable of better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I pitty them very much. Let them but be quiet and not ſeek to govern us by their fancies and prejudices, and I for my part ſhall not look upon their averſion as a vice, if they will not account it their great Vertue. For what if ſome Children receive impreſſions and inclinations in their infancy from their Mothers big-bellied frights or longings, which they carry with them to their graves? What is the World concern'd in <hi>this,</hi> or in thoſe mens unaccountable Antipathies? Is any man more <hi>commendable</hi> for them? Surely no; but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more <hi>troubleſome.</hi> You have ſeen it's like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a perſon (pardon the inſtance I uſe, becauſe it's familiar) as ſoon as the Cheeſe after Meal has been ſet on the board, preſently make ſcurvy faces and change colour, ſtop his noſe, or run in haſt out of the room; yet neither the Maſter or gueſts are farther concern'd in this, than to pitty, or perhaps but ſmile or ſlightly complement the mans infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and none forbears the more to taſt that hath a need or a good liking. But you never heard of any ſuch man who, in a conceited humour, thought fit in this caſe, that his particular averſion ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:63803:4"/>preſcribe to all others; or raiſed fierce diſputes about it in every company; and contended that this was no <hi>Primitive food,</hi> or at leaſt that our way was not the <hi>Primitive way</hi> of making it: that indeavoured buſily to make a party againſt it among the indifferent and uninclin'd either to love or hate it? much leſs that reviled and gave reproachful Nick-names to thoſe that uſed it, and ſought for Orders to baniſh it from every Table. If you could ſuppoſe ſuch prodigious folly, you would not blame the Neighbourhood, eſpecially the Officers, if they were concern'd in it, or any that ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ridiculouſneſs, or the malice of ſuch an undertaking. I know the inſtance is not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough to be applied to all things at this day conteſted, but to a great many it may; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes well enough the humour of thoſe, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their breeding, ſeem with an <hi>equal paſſion</hi> to oppoſe every thing they diſlike, even to the colour of a Garment, or the faſhion of a Girdle. You have enough (Readers) concerning the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to this Continuation of the <hi>Debate,</hi> when you are only told this farther, that the Author having heard of ſome exceptions againſt the <hi>former</hi> Book, thought good to Anſwer, and (as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) to ſhame them in <hi>this.</hi> It is like <hi>ſome of our deceived Brethren will hold this labour damnable and execrable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface to the Confutation of the Errors of the Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts. B. 2.</note> 
               <hi>as being beſtowed</hi> in their opinion, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of Chriſt, againſt

            </p>
            <p>And now I believe nothing would be more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſome than to know the Authors name: but I have nothing to ſay to them, but that it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent curioſity to inquire any farther after him, ſince he hath no mind to be known, and ſince there is no need of it. For his name can add no credit or ſtrength to his Reaſons; and as for matters of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fact, he hath directed you where to find them, without inquiring after him to be reſolved about them. But if any body think it good manners to inquire into that which others would have kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; Yet I am ſure it argues great want of good breeding (to ſay no more) to beſpatter (as ſome have done) this and the other perſon whom they only conjecture to be the Author; <hi>Laying to their charge things that they know not.</hi> Let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them to be more Civil; Since I am ſure they
<pb facs="tcp:63803:5"/>do not yet know me, nor I believe, ever ſhall, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I pleaſe; and ſince by diſturbing themſelves and others ſtill in this kind, they are like to reap nothing ſave their own further ſhame.

               <p>To ſee you ſo far from mending your Schiſm, that you proceed to make it wider; and divide our very language. Why cannot you ſpeak as the reſt of your Neighbors, and ſay, <hi>Well I thank God?</hi> Is it a commendable thing to be <hi>Singular</hi> without any need? and to ſeparate from us even in your words and forms of ſpeech? Or is this a part of the <hi>Language of Canaan</hi> (ſo much talk't of in the late times) to be learnt of all thoſe, that will be accounted the <hi>People of God?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Take heed how you ſpeak againſt the <hi>Iſrael of God.</hi> They are a peculiar people, and muſt not do after the manner of the Nations.</p>

               <p>What Nations? Do you take us to be all Heathens? Nay, ſuch Heathens from whom you are not only to <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi> your ſelves, but utterly to <hi>root out?</hi>

               <p>I am not one of thoſe; but I and many others, when we are askt about our welfare, dare not ſpeak as you do, leſt we ſhould <hi>take Gods name in Vain:</hi> of which you know <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to be very careful.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Is it to no purpoſe then to thank God for our own and our Families health? Or to pray God would be with our Friend when we meet or part with him? Perhaps you think that <hi>Boaz</hi> took Gods name in vain, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtome in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he ſaid to his Reapers, <hi>the Lord be with you:</hi> and that they were Offenders for replying, <hi>the Lord bleſs thee.</hi> I doubt ere long you will refuſe to ſay upon occaſion, <hi>GOD SAVE THE KING,</hi> for fear of taking Gods name in Vain.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Not ſo. We can uſe ſuch words when we are very ſerious, but not commonly.</p>

               <p>You made me believe, the laſt time we talk't to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that you were <hi>commonly,</hi> if not <hi>alwayes,</hi> Serious. But now it ſeems the world is altered with you.</p>

               <p>We are afraid you are not Serious; but uſe theſe words ſo careleſly that you break the <hi>Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:</hi> upon which account we would teach you to refrain them.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>You are excellent Interpreters of Holy Scripture What a rare Comment ſhould we have upon it, if all your Expoſitions were but gathered and put together? As you find words now uſed in common talk, ſo they ſound to your fancy there: And this makes you take it ſo oft into your mouths in vain; I mean beſides its purpoſe and intention. Alas! that you ſhould be no better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63803:10"/>than generally to entertain this conceit, that a man breaks the <hi>third Commandment,</hi> if he mention the Name of God, without lifting up his Eyes, clapping his Hand on his Breaſt, or ſome ſignification of Devotion! This abſurd Fancy I have heard ſome alledge as a Reaſon why they would not let their Children ask them Bleſſing; <hi>i. e.</hi> deſire them to pray to God for them: And others have made this the cauſe why they would not teach them their Catechiſm, nor any Prayers, leſt they ſhould take Gods Name in vain; that is, in their ſenſe, make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and not mind what they ſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If you did, you would condemn your ſelf many hundred times in a Day. For how oft do you tell us in common diſcourſe, of <hi>the People of God,</hi> and <hi>the things of God,</hi> and <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> not minding that you mention his Name. Nay how many times have we heard you ſay in your Prayers, O LORD, O GOD (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thrice in one ſentence) when we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think you did not know whether you uſed it ſo oft or no. Now, which will you ſay? That you ſinned in this; or that it is ſufficient to have an habitual Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence toward Almighty God, and never to uſe his Name in an irreverent manner; though we do not alwayes actually attend when we uſe it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I have not conſidered this; but was alway bred in a Belief that we break the <hi>Third Commandment</hi> when we uſe Gods name in common talk; and that's the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I did not anſwer you after the uſual manner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It's well if you be not more careful to keep the Commandment in the <hi>Phraſe-ſenſe,</hi> than in its proper and Principal meaning.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It cannot be new to you ſure, who are ſo well verſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63803:11"/>in a Divinity that conſiſts, in a manner, wholly of Phraſes; and ſetting them aſide, hath little or nothing in it, upon which account it may well be called, <hi>Phraſe-Divinity.</hi>

               <p>You will never leave your Pleaſantneſs. Pray talk more gravely, and explain your ſelf.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I'le tell you then what I mean. There are many I obſerve, who have been very ſcrupulous about the Third Commandment, and careful to keep it, as the words are vulgarly uſed in our language now a-dayes; who have made no Conſcience at all of it, at leaſt notoriouſly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, according to the true import of the Words among the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> For, as I have been taught, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain,</hi> &amp;c. His meaning was; that no man ſhould dare to call God to witneſs any thing he ſpoke, and yet utter a falſhood, or not do according to his promiſe. If he were ſo prophane, he aſſures him that God who was <hi>Witneſs</hi> to what he ſaid, would alſo be his <hi>Judg,</hi> and by no means acquit him. Now how oft you have broken the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment in this, which is the main ſenſe; while you have been very ſtrict to keep it in the other, I need not tell you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt tell me; or elſe I muſt tell you that you are like the <hi>Devil, a falſe accuſer of the Brethren.</hi>

               <p>Your Miniſters can tell you a great deal better than I, who were wont to complain of this as one of the moſt grievous ſins of the times; that ſo many had <hi>forſworn themſelves by breaking their Solemn League and Covenant.</hi> You covenanted, for inſtance, to extirpate <hi>Hereſy and Schiſm;</hi> and ſuch great diligence was uſed in this point, that they grew faſter, and to a greater height than ever had been known among us. So Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> tells the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in his <hi>Thanks-giving Sermon</hi> for the taking of <hi>Cheſter</hi> p. 25. And asks them <hi>how it comes to paſs that theſe abound more than ever they did, and that under their Noſes? There is ſuch a numerous increaſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63803:11"/>Errors and Hereſies, as I bluſh to repeat what ſome have affirmed, namely, that there are no leſs than an hundred and fourſcore ſeveral Hereſies propagated and ſpred in this Neigboring City. And many of ſuch a Nature, as that I may truly ſay, in CALVIN'S language, the Errors and innovations under which we groaned of late years</hi> (He means under the Biſhops) <hi>were but tollerable trifles, childrens play, compared with theſe damnable Doctrines, Doctrines of Devils.</hi> Nor is he alone in theſe complaints, but Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. Ded. to both Houſes before his Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graena, 1. part.</note> craves leave to be free with them, and to tell them that Sects had been growing ever ſince the firſt year of their ſitting; and every year increaſed more and more. No ſooner had they put down the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> but down went the <hi>Scriptures</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together with it, which many among us (ſaith he) ſlight and blaſpheme. The Images of the <hi>Trinity, Chriſt, Virgin Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were ordered to be broken down; and at the next ſtroke there were thoſe that overthrew the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Trinity, oppoſed the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt, ſpoke <hi>Evil</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſlighted all the Apoſtles. The Parliament caſt out the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the Sacraments, the <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Kneeling;</hi> and then the People in many places caſt out the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelves;</hi> Baptiſm and the Lords Supper. The one took away <hi>Saints dayes,</hi> and ſome of the other made nothing of the <hi>Lords-day.</hi> The ſuperfluous maintenance as he calls it, of Biſhops and Deans being cut off, immediately the neceſſary ſetled maintenance of all Miniſters was cryed down and denyed too. Nay the Biſhops &amp; their Officers being gone, there were many that would have thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Miniſters after them. A great deal more you may find there to the ſame purpoſe if you have a mind; but he ſeems to ſum up all in this; <hi>the Fourth Commandment was taken away in the Biſhops dayes</hi> (ſo he is pleaſed to calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63803:12"/>them) <hi>but now we have all ten Commandments taken away at once by the Antinomians; yea all Faith and the Goſpel deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Seekers.</hi> He would have inſerted this clauſe ſure, if he durſt; <hi>the Third Commandment is now taken away by the Parliament.</hi> For I pray you, my good Friend, what remembrance had they of the dreadful name of God, to whom they had lifted up their hands? What a trifle was that ſacred Oath now accounted? <hi>That water of life which</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> fancied<note n="*" place="margin">Sermons about the Covenant, p. 66.</note>) <hi>had kept all the Nation from giving up the ghoſt,</hi> was dead it ſelf; and had not the leaſt ſpirit remaining in it, to quicken theſe <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters</hi> to extirpate Hereſies. Nor would all the expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of their Miniſters put any life into them: But as theſe complainers had violated other obligations in taking that <hi>Covenant;</hi> ſo now their Maſters ſet it at naught, and, to ſerve the ends of State, continued to connive at thoſe things which they promiſed to root out. For a great while after this, I find no leſs than three of your Divines (in their Epiſtle to the Reader before Mr. <hi>Pooles</hi> book againſt <hi>Biddle</hi>) renew their Complaints, <hi>that the whole body of Socinianiſm which walkt only in the Dark, and in Latin, in the Biſhops time, was now tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into Engliſh. Many bold Factors for thoſe Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which in thoſe times durſt not appear, diſſeminating now their Hereſies without fear, both publickly and from houſe to houſe:</hi> Which by the way may inſtruct you who are to be charged with a great part of the guilt and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of ſuch Books as the <hi>Sandy-Foundation</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Doctrine of the Trinity) <hi>Shaken,</hi> and ſeveral others lately publiſhed. In ſhort, this was a thing ſo notorious, that Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> moves the Parliament (in that Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermon <hi>p.</hi> 30.) that there might be a ſolemn faſt to humble and afflict their Souls for <hi>Covenant-violations, and wherein the Covenant might be renewed in a more ſolemn and ſerious manner with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Now if you read their <hi>Seaſonable exhortation</hi> to their reſpective Pariſhes, printed 1660. you will find, they complain of <hi>the Odious ſcandals of thoſe that profeſs themſelves the People of God: particularly of their ſelf-ſeeking under pretence of the publick good; and their unparalel'd breach of all civil and ſacred Oaths and Covenants both to God and Men.</hi>

               <p>Conſider then I beſeech you; if theſe Leaders and great Profeſſors were ſo guilty, what ſhall we think of the common People, who took the Covenant hand over head (as we ſay) being totally ignorant of ſeveral things to which they ſwore: nay were taught by Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> (in his Sermons about the Covenant <hi>p.</hi> 41.) <hi>to take it, though they did not underſtand it?</hi>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Go to the Book then and believe your own Eyes. There you will find he alledges the Example of <hi>Joſiah</hi> for it, who renewed the Covenant when he was a Child; and of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> who made the Women and Children do the like. He was ſenſible indeed, that there is a great difference between that which was <hi>Divine,</hi> and this which was but the <hi>Device of men;</hi> and therefore would perſwade them that they were bound no further by this Oath, than they ſhould find the things contained in it to be <hi>according to the Word of God.</hi> But it is plain, I ſhew'd you the laſt time, the Parliament did not allow any Body to expound the Covenant but themſelves. And beſide this, they ſware without any limitation to preſerve things as they ſtood in the <hi>Church of Scotland,</hi> where for any thing they knew, there might be as abſolute a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63803:13"/>Tyranny, as is exerciſed under the Papacy. Nay, in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> it ſelf, there were ſome who argued ſo ſtrongle againſt the Convenant, that a Jolly man I have read of,<note place="margin">Mr. Andr. Cant.</note> was driven to ſuch ſtraits at laſt, as he had nothing to ſay but his, <hi>That they muſt deny Learning and Reaſon, and help Chriſt as Life.</hi> If you will give me leave, I'le tell you ſomething worſe than this.</p>

               <p>It ought not to be forgot, that this <hi>Covenant</hi> was contrary to you <hi>Solemn Proteſtation,</hi> taken firſt by both Houſes of Parliament, wherein they promiſed <hi>to defend the true reformed Proteſtant Religion, expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of England.</hi> Did they not?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>They explain'd themſelves as I remember, before they Covenanted, and told us what they

               <p>Very good. And was it not finely done, that after the Members of both Houſes had taken the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,</hi> ſo as I now ſaid, the Houſe of Commons alone ſhould make a <hi>Declaration,</hi> that by thoſe words [<hi>the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England] was intended only ſo much of it, as was oppoſite to Popery and Popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, and ſhould not be extended to the maintenance of the Diſcipline and Government? And then that under this Explication publiſhed only by the <hi>Commons</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſſented to by the <hi>Peers,</hi> this Proteſtation was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the Kingdom, and all that would not take it declared unfit to bear office in Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? What is there to be ſaid, I beſeech you, to excuſed theſe ſtrange proceedings. Firſt, both Houſes ſwear to plain words. Then one Houſe claps an interpretation on them. And after that, they alone ſo far intrench upon the Peoples Liberties (which they were bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) as to impoſe this <hi>Proteſtation</hi> upon them without conſent of Parliament: and that under a heavy penalty on thoſe that ſhould not comply with them. All this is no leſs than a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> methinks, that too many of you (for we will not condemn all) have been too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to take Gods name in vain; at leaſt to ingage your ſelves in Oaths and Vows haſtily and raſhly. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it ſhews that you were of that impoſing Spirit which you now complain of; and that Religion was more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended than truly aim'd at: And laſtly, that you were ſo vainly confident your favour with God, that you could take his name into your mouths backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and never bluſh; ſo you did but look demurely, and expreſs much reverence to it in common talk. All which I proteſt, is ſpoken to no other purpoſe but to humble you; and to ſhew that you unjuſtly uſurp the name of the <hi>moſt Religious People, the moſt conſcientious,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63803:14"/>and the moſt fearful of offending God,</hi> that are in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that you abuſe the ſimple, when you make them believe that you are the <hi>Pillars</hi> upon which the Kingdoms welfare ſtands; for whoſe ſake alone it is, that we were not made long ago <hi>like Sodom and Gomorrah.</hi> For it is manifeſt you have involv'd the people in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of guilt and made Religion vile in their eyes, and helpt to bring the name of God, which you have taken ſo oft in vain, into great contempt.</p>

               <p>You ſay right: otherwiſe I ſhould have told you of a freſh guilt of this kind. For I am informed ſome have ſet up Schools for the inſtructing Youth in Logick and Philoſophy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> directly contrary to the Oath they took in the Univerſity. But I am run beſide my intention in this diſcourſe: having told you, I remember, it would be in vain to diſpute any more; and therefore deſired, when we met again, the time might be ſpent to other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I have not forgot it. But if you will go in here, we will not wrangle at all, but only talk fairly, as loving Friends, of ſome matters in which you are concerned.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I ſuppoſe it is about our old buſineſs, and then you had better conſider of what I have ſaid already. If that will not move you, I have little hope to do any good upon you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>You are a ſtrange man. When I had no great mind to be troubled with your Diſcourſe, then you would never have done. And now that I am earneſt to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in ſome things, you hang back and have nothing to ſay. Methinks you might be willing, at leaſt, to receive an account of my Thoughts concerning our late Debate.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Have you then conſidered what I ſaid, as you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed you would?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Yeas that I have. And being ſomewhat ſtagger'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63803:14"/>with it, I thought good to conſult with ſome Chriſtian friends, and hear their Opinion, which I prefer before my own.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>And what was the iſſue?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive they are generally offended at you to a high degree.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>So were the Scribes and Phariſees at our Saviour. And for any thing I know both upon the ſame ſcore, becauſe you are plainly told of your faults. This nettles and vexes you at the heart: only to hide and conceal your ſecret anger; you call it by another name, and ſay you are offended.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>No they are not angry with thoſe who give them a private reproof, but to print a book againſt them, what can it intend, but miſchief?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Now I gueſs at their meaning. Their offence is of the ſame nature with that which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſaith the Sectaries took at his <hi>Gangraena,</hi> * <hi>Becauſe it hinders their making Proſelytes, and ſo for want of growing up to ſuch a number as they deſign and hope for, they may miſs of a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, and ſo in the iſſue a Domination, which is ſo much ſought for by them.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>They mean the ſame that the Apoſtle doth, who requires us to <hi>give no offence neither to the Jews, nor to the Greeks, nor to the Church of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.32.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>By your favour Sir, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and you have not the ſame meaning: as you might have learnt long ago (if you did not converſe more with your frivolous wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, than thoſe who have ſome ſenſe in them) from your great Champion Mr. <hi>Cartwright.</hi> He tells you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly that by <hi>offence</hi> the Apoſtle doth not intend, <hi>that which diſpleaſeth, or diſcontents,</hi> but that whereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is given to any of tranſgreſſing againſt the Laws of God. For he is treating of eating things offered to Idols even in the Temples of Idols, or in the preſence of ſuch
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63803:15"/>as were indangered thereby: The Gentiles being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Idolatry, the Jews provoked againſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and ſome Chriſtians drawn by ſuch examples to follow them doubtingly. Take now the Word in this proper ſenſe, and I ſhall be cleared from this imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and you your ſelves condemned for looking no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to your feet, that they go not awry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>How ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It is the very deſign of my Book to keep you from falling into ſin any more: and to direct you to ſuch a Courſe that you may not break the Laws of God again your ſelves; nor caſt ſuch a ſtumbling-block before others, that they take occaſion to break them too, If any have miſinterpreted my meaning, or out of anger and vexation grown worſe and more audaciouſly violent by my writing, they muſt bear the blame which they would throw upon me. Nay, a far greater blame, for they both <hi>take</hi> Offence, when none was given, and they notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <hi>give</hi> Offence to others, whom I would have kept from offending.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>They will believe both alike; that you meant to take away Offences, and that they lay any in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That is; they ſeldom believe any good of others, or any ill of themſelves. But I do not beg your belief, for it is manifeſt to any unprejudiced reaſon, that the Book was ſent abroad on no other Errand, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſtumbling blocks out of every bodies way; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally your Shiſm which is the greateſt of all. And if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, you be ſcandalized, and confidently affirm it were better to forbear ſuch writings, you ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the mouths of ſome of the old and better <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts.</hi> Who tell their Brethren of <hi>New-England</hi> (and I ſay the ſame to you) when they would have had them forbear to read the Common-Prayer becauſe of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63803:15"/>ſcandal it gave to ſome; <hi>It is a ſcandal taken and not given; and by forbearing, we ſhall offend you the more, if to confirm men in error be to ſcandalize them; yea we ſhall prejudice the Truth; and it might be an occaſion to beget needleſs ſcruples in others, and draw men ignorantly from the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Saints and the holy Ordinances of God, and ſtrengthen them who by your own confeſſion, are run too far into Schiſm already.</hi>

               <p>You may find them <hi>p.</hi> 16. in the <hi>Reply</hi> made 1640. by many Miniſters in <hi>Old-England,</hi> to the <hi>Anſwer</hi> which their <hi>N. E.</hi> Brethren gave to their enquiry about 9. po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in the year 1637. And I would to God your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters would lay them to heart, and no longer continue to harden their Followers in Schiſm, by forbearing the uſe of that which they know is lawful. Remember I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you the famous obſervation of a great Author,<note n="*" place="margin">Lord Bacon Eſſay of Unity in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> that <hi>Hereſies and Schiſms are of all other the greateſt ſcandals, yea, more than the corruption of manners. For as in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body a Wound or Solution of continuity is worſe than a corrupt Humour; ſo it is in the Spiritual. Nothing doth ſo much keep men from the Church, and drive men out of it, as breach of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> One of his Reaſons is, becauſe <hi>every Sect hath a divers poſture, or cringe by themſelves, which cannot but move deriſion in worldlings and depraved Politicks, who are apt to contemn holy things.</hi> It is poſſible you may thinks, for you are very cenſorious, that he was no better than one of thoſe depraved perſons, and ſo take no heed to his words. Let me remember your therefore, that there was a time when the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> applauded this obſervation, and laboured to ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it. For I find it cited in a Book call's <hi>wholſome Severity reconciled with Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> licenſed by Mr. <hi>Cranford</hi> 1644. where the Author likewiſe ſayes, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63803:16"/>
                  <hi>the experience of former times makes us ſo wiſe, as to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that Hereſie and Schiſm tend to the breach of the Civil peace, and to a rupture in the State as well as the Church.</hi> Of which he gives many inſtances, eſpecially the <hi>Donatists</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> But now it ſeems you are grown ſtark blind; and whereas you had a foreſight in times paſt, at preſent you cannot or will not ſee what is before your eyes —</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I told you I would not enter into long diſputes with you. But I am heartily ſorry that your have ſo much <hi>grieved all the Godly.</hi>

               <p>You ſtill perſiſt in your old Uncharitableneſs, Pride, and high eſteem of your ſelves above all others. Or if you mean, only all the Godly of your way, yet you are guilty of great partiality; in taking a liberty which you will not give. For you ſay what you liſt againſt that way, wherein ſo many good people among us truly ſerve God, and make it ungodlineſs in us to ſay any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt yours. Pray give me a reaſon, when you have duly conſider'd it, of this unequal dealing. You ſpeak and write againſt the <hi>Biſhops, Common-Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;</hi> nay many of you openly revile them to the juſt grief of our People, and all this with a reputation of great Godlineſs: But we muſt ſow up our mouths, and not ſay a word againſt you and your devices; or elſe be accounted ungodly and prophane, nay it is well if we eſcape the brand of Atheiſm. What is this, but to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thoſe Huckſters, who have double weights and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances, one for buying, another for ſelling? To have one meaſure for your ſelves, and another for all other folk?</p>

               <p>But you ſide with thoſe that play theſe tricks. And beſides; you that are ſo loth to be <hi>grieved</hi> in the vulgar meaning of the words make light of grieving others in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63803:16"/>the proper ſenſe of it. For you have ſo ſorely galled and wounded many by your practices, that the Anguiſh hath been ſuch as (according to the Obſervation now named) to thruſt ſome back who were coming to us, and drive others out, who were among us. The Reproaches, I mean, which you have caſt upon our Church, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions you have made, the confuſion you have been Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of, have been ſuch thorns in ſome mens way, that when they were juſt at the door of our Church they have drawn back their foot and faln back to the <hi>Popiſh Religion.</hi> Of this I have good evidence; and ſuch as you dare not queſtion of the other; that ſome have taken ſuch diſtaſt at the ſtate of things among us, as to turn aſide out of the right way, into the by-paths of Romiſh Superſtition and Idolatry. Witneſs the <hi>Seaſonable Exhortation</hi> of a great number of the <hi>London</hi>-Miniſters; who tell us <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>That ſome are faln from the Truth which they ſaw ſo much despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and back ſlidden to Popery, as the only Religion, in their opinion, wherein Vnity and Order is maintained.</hi> And a little after, <hi>p.</hi> 16. they ſay <hi>they are afraid leſt too many may be too well conceited of that Religion, finding</hi> Rome <hi>juſtified by</hi> Englands <hi>Confuſion, as</hi> Sodom <hi>was by</hi> Iſraels <hi>ſin.</hi> You may ſay perhaps, according to your uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that all theſe were wicked. But this is not ſo eaſily proved, as peremptorily ſaid. And there want not good reaſons to make us think, that ſeveral well diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by occaſion of this Schiſm and the Scorn caſt upon our Governors and Divine Service, which accompanies it; have forſaken our. Communion, and gone thither where they heard there was more Unity, Order, and reverence to Authority.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63803:17"/>frequent with ſuch as Mr. <hi>Bridge,</hi> than to teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that our way of <hi>Worſhip</hi> and Church Government is Antichriſtian. Read but the 5. of his <hi>Ten Sermons</hi> p. 370. and you will ſee I do not bely him. Or, for more full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I refer you to another Book of his called <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Truths in Evil Times</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Newly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, 1668.</note>, where you may find him inſtructing them too plainly (<hi>p.</hi> 118.) that ſuch as he have their <hi>Orders to preach or propheſy from Jeſus Chriſt himſelf;</hi> but Others (by whom he can mean none but our Miniſters) <hi>have their Orders and power from Men, from Prelates, from the Beaſt:</hi> for theſe are all one in his language. Nay more than this, he teaches the pooreſt, weakeſt man or woman <hi>to go to Jeſus Chriſt for a power to Propheſy:</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring them what one <hi>Alice Driver</hi> ſaid in <hi>Queen Mary</hi>'s daies, <hi>I'le ſet my foot againſt the foot of the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Prelate of them all, in the cauſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And therefore <hi>why ſhould you not go to Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and lay your ſelves flat upon the Promiſe, and ſay to him, O Lord, I am a poor weak creature, I fear I ſhall never be able to bear my Teſtimony; but thou haſt ſaid, I will give power to my two witneſſes, and I am one of thy witneſſes: Now then O Lord, give power to me,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Where did you get the ſole privilege of writing Dialogues? You imagine, perhaps, we have forgot thoſe that you entertain'd the people withal ſome years ago; but our memories are not yet ſo ſlippery. I call to mind, for inſtance, the Dialogue between a <hi>Countrey-Gentleman</hi> and a <hi>miniſter of the Word</hi> about the Common-Prayer, anſwered by Authority 1641. And another between a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63803:18"/>
                  <hi>Loyaliſt,</hi> and a <hi>Royaliſt,</hi> about our Civil Liberties, <hi>an.</hi> 1644. The firſt of theſe I can ſcarce forget, if I would; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it (Mr. <hi>Lowes Hughes</hi>) imparting to me, ſuch an extraordinary piece of Learning as this, that <hi>Kyrieleeſon</hi> is a word compounded of <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> ſignifying in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Lord have mercy upon us. He furniſht me alſo with a memorable reaſon, why the <hi>Maſs-Book</hi> leaves out the <hi>Dexology</hi> at the end of the Lords Prayer; <hi>becauſe the Pope,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>will have none of his Church, neither Prieſt nor People, to give ſo much honour and glory to God.</hi> Which he was ſo well conceited of, that he repeats it twice within the compaſs of a few leaves. This good man, I ſometimes fancy, would have been a choſen inſtrument, and done marvelous well, to write a RATIONALE of the <hi>Directory.</hi> In which he might have told us, that RATIONALE was a word compounded of <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſignifying, <hi>All Reaſon.</hi> And inform'd us, in particular, that the cauſe why the Aſſembly left it to mens liberty, to leave out the whole Lords Prayer if they pleaſed, was only this, <hi>that all their Church might give all honour and glory to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So I ſuppoſe his <hi>Affection</hi> would have made him ſay; though if he had followed his <hi>Reaſon</hi> it would have led him to this; <hi>that as the Pope left out ſome of it becauſe he would not do our Saviour ſo much honour: ſo they permitted men to leave out all, that every man might do him as little honour as he pleaſed.</hi>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63803:18"/>againſt the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> is guilty of; where the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> makes the <hi>Gentleman</hi> preſently confeſs it to be full of <hi>Popiſh Errors;</hi> and to appoint <hi>horrible Blaſphemies,</hi> and <hi>lying Fables</hi> to be read to the People.

               <p>So one would think; and yet he had ſo good an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of himſelf, that he thought ſuch Works as theſe fit for the eyes of the <hi>High Court of Parliament.</hi> To whom I find he preſented <hi>Certain Grievances</hi> an. 1640. of the very ſame import with this goodly Dialogue, but ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly ſlanderous, that you cannot but be aſtoniſh't at his brutiſh ſtupidity. For there he tells them (as he doth the <hi>Gentleman</hi> at the concluſion of their Conference) that the Biſhops have appointed ſome portions of Scripture to be read on certain dayes and omitted others, <hi>on purpoſe to pervert the meaning of Chriſt, and to keep weak Chriſtians in blindneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> for inſtance, is never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be read; <hi>that the People</hi> (as he will have it) <hi>may not be able to ſee the ardent Love and affection of Chriſt toward his Spouſe, the Elect:</hi> and they <hi>thereby be ſtirred
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63803:19"/>up to love Chriſt, and be truly zealous for his Glory.</hi> Nay, if you believe him, the Books of the <hi>Kings,</hi> (all ſave the 8 firſt chapters) <hi>and the Chronicles were forbid, becauſe they ſhew that Godly Kings did ever love Gods true Prophets, and did hearken to them, and were zealous of maintaining true Religion, and ſuppreſſing Idolatry.</hi> In which words he diſcovered the very grounds of their quarrel with the King, <hi>viz.</hi> that he did not take ſuch great <hi>Seers</hi> as himſelf into his boſom; and ſuffer them to guide his Conſcience, as if they were of the <hi>Privy-Council of Heaven.</hi> But he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered withal how little eſteem he for his part, merited: Or rather how well he deſerved to be ſtigmatiz'd and branded in the forehead, as one, (to ſpeak in his own language) <hi>that was a falſe-Prophet, Propheſying lyes.</hi> For was there ever any man before this ſo impudent, as to put a Libel of this Nature againſt his ſpiritual Fathers and Governors, into the hands of the Higheſt Court of the Kingdom? Did any of the <hi>Prieſts or Prophets of Baal</hi> think you, ever help themſelves and their cauſe by ſuch inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives againſt the Prophets of the Lord? For my part, I am of the mind, that the Devil himſelf would be hard put to't, to invent more bold and malicious Slanders than theſe of this mans forging; who wanted nothing but <hi>wit</hi> to make him like that <hi>Father of Lyes.</hi> And yet, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he paſſed for a <hi>Godly man,</hi> a <hi>precious Servant of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>Faithful Miniſter of the Lord:</hi> Nay, was cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and incouraged as one of <hi>Gods Prophets;</hi> who had told them things that could be known no wayes, but by a Revelation His Book alſo, no doubt, found wonderful acceptance, though it was ſtuft with ſo much Ignorance and railing. The people read it with a blind Devotion, juſt as he was tranſported with ſo blind a Paſſion, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our Church of that, which all that had eyes muſt needs acquit it of. For both the Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> were Appointed to be read intirely in the later end of <hi>April,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:63803:19"/>and in <hi>May.</hi> As for the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> they being little more than a Repetition of what was writ before, might well be left to our private Reading; together with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books, not eaſy to be underſtood without great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and long Meditation.</p>

               <p>Your people would not, when time was, ſo eaſily lay his Book out of their hands, as I am able to prove. But let him go; together with all the Crew of Revilers that were before him. For you muſt know there were <hi>Dialogue-writers</hi> of the ſame Stamp in the dayes of your Fore-fathers. In one of which Books, called the <hi>Dialogue of White Devils,</hi> the Author expreſly tells us, <hi>that if Princes hinder the bringing in of their Diſciples, they are Tyrants; and may be depoſed by their Subjects.</hi> A Doctrine which with all your reading in the Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Chronicles</hi> you will no where find juſtified. For the people were better taught than to go about to depoſe thoſe that did not favour the Lords Prophets. I know you all diſclaim this principle; and I verily believe many of you abhor it: but I mention it to let you ſee what the Maximes of ſome of your Predeceſſors, imboldned ſome of their Poſterity to do. For this purpoſe I could relate ſtrange paſſages out of ſome Books eſteemed by your Party; which would verify the cenſure of the Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Conner</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In his Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpeed at Liſnegarvy, 1638. publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſh'd by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> upon the Title of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue now named. Which he ſaith was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit for ſuch mens Books; <hi>for if ever there were</hi> White Devils, <hi>or Devils transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Angels of Light, it is in their perſons who under the pretence of Sanctity, labour to bring in all manner of Diſorder into the Church, and confuſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Common wealth.</hi> But you have no mind we ſhould remember any thing that is paſt; that ſo you may the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63803:20"/>more confidently fill the world with loud clamors, as if there never were ſuch doings, as now. Elſe you might know there was another Dialogue in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, between <hi>Diotrephes</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in which the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and its Favourers are magnified as <hi>Apoſtolical:</hi> but the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England</hi> made no better than ſo many proud <hi>Diotrephes</hi>'s; nay ſo many <hi>Devils;</hi> and he of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (ſo they ſpeak) is <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> even the Prince of the Devils.</p>

               <p>I muſt ingeniouſly confeſs that we cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you of ſuch ſpeeches as theſe; but yet you ſhew your great malignity to us otherwayes. In particular it is very ill taken, that you make our Miniſters guilty of breaking the <hi>Oxford Act,</hi> and the <hi>Act againſt Conventicles.</hi> For you make as if they were obliged to keep within that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from this place which the Law preſcribes, if they have not taken the Oath: And if they have; yet not to hold Aſſemblies (without Common-Prayer) eſpecially in time of your Service. Now it is plain to us, that they are not obliged to keep theſe Laws, ſo as you would have them. Mark what I ſay; they do not refuſe to obey them; only they cannot do it in your manner. There are two wayes I have heard them ſay ſometimes, of obeying Laws; either by <hi>doing</hi> what they Command, or by <hi>ſuffering</hi> what they inflict. Now our Miniſters are content to endure the penalties; chuſing to ſatisfie the Laws that way, which is moſt convenient for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <p>Then give me leave to tell you, I do not believe they are ſo well contented as you pretend. But if they be; they are no better obſervers of Laws than a Thief, who is content to be hang'd after he hath rob'd his neighbors. I doubt they are contented both alike, <hi>i. e.</hi> they hope to eſcape without puniſhment; and when they are laid hold on, they ſubmit becauſe they cannot help it. But when that's done, they are ſtill both alike under ſin; becauſe it is not the thiefs hanging, and your fine and impriſonment, which the Prince intends; but the doing that which he commands. If this be neglected, or you do contrary to his Laws; you offend God as well as your Prince, and are liable to be puniſht by both.</p>

               <p>There is a wide difference in theſe things. For God you know requires we ſhould not ſteal; but he doth not lay ſuch Commands on us, as your Laws.</p>

               <p>He requires you to obey the Magiſtrate; which your Apology plainly confeſſes, while you ſuppoſe he is ſufficiently obeyed if you ſuffer the penalties of his Laws. Which I muſt tell you, is a ridiculous fancie; and makes the Magiſtrate a moſt barbarous Tyrant; who is as well pleaſed, or takes himſelf to be as well obeyed, if his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be hang'd or broken on the Wheel after they have done a world of Miſchief; as if they had been honeſt and peaceable Members of the Common-wealth. Away with theſe <hi>abſurd doctrines:</hi> which ſuppoſe all Governors to puniſh the innocent; and all Subjects to obey meerly <hi>for wrath</hi> and not <hi>for Conſcience ſake.</hi> You had beſt go and correct St. <hi>Paul:</hi> or elſe correct your ſelves; believing that you are guilty of a ſin when you do not the things which a Law not contrary to God's, requires, or elſe the Magiſtrate could have no right to puniſh you: and that your Puniſhment alſo is not to free you from the guilt of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Fault; but to prevent a <hi>Second.</hi>

               <p>I was going to tell you, if you would but be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.

Do you not think the King can diſpenſe with us? and doth he not in effect give us a diſpenſation when his Laws are not executed? Why do you then diſallow, what he approves of?

And confeſs in plain terms that when they broke the Ice, and firſt took this Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they were Sinners: and now they make one ſin the Juſtification of another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>How ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>They firſt tried whether any notice would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their abiding here, and of their cloſer meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings contrary to Law: and when they found there was none; then they ventured further, and opened their doors more confidently for all comers: and ſtill there being no notice taken of this licenſe they gave themſelves; now they make it an argument to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what they do, and would perſwade us it is as good, as if they had a licenſe from others for theſe unlawful practices. So I call them: for you muſt know further, that the <hi>Non-execution of the Laws,</hi> is no proof of his Majeſtie's pleaſure they ſhould not be obſerved. For it may be imputed to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of his Officers and Miniſters in the diſcharge of their Duty. But if to ſerve your turn, you will ſay it is an argument of <hi>his</hi> will and not of <hi>their</hi> neglect; you muſt unavoidably ſerve ſome bodies turn beſides your own. In plain Engliſh you muſt affirm it is his pleaſure that the <hi>Maſs</hi> ſhould be ſaid, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould take the ſame liberty and openneſs in the exerciſe of their Religion, that you do in yours. Nay, I do not ſee why all Drunkards, Swearers, and Blaſphemers may not think themſelves allowed in their crimes; becauſe little or no notice is taken of any of them. To which I may add, that ſeveral
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63803:22"/>perſons who think the non-Execution of Laws is a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to you; yet find very much fault with your meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the time of our publick Aſſemblies: Which is void of all ſenſe if your Reaſon be good; for there is no more notice taken of that, than of your meeting at other times. And yet it is demonſtrable that the <hi>not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing</hi> your meeting in time of Divine Service doth not ſignifie his Majeſtie's pleaſure to allow it; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>your not being puniſhed,</hi> can never ſignifie his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to indulge you in other matters. For if from thence <hi>you</hi> can gather that he approves of what you do, then ſo may <hi>we</hi> if we liſt to do the ſame: And upon that ground may meet in little companies where we pleaſe, and leave our Churches quite empty. A thing, without all doubt, which his Majeſty abhors to think of. You your ſelves have declared in times paſt, <hi>that it is abſurd to think, that Laws nay Ordinances of Parliament (even in matters of Religion) ſhould not equally oblige all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of one Kingdom.</hi> If therefore the Laws oblige <hi>us,</hi> then they oblige <hi>you:</hi> If they do not oblige you, then they oblige not us neither. We are all alike either bound or free.</p>
               <p>But to leave all theſe Conſiderations; there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more remarkable me thinks in this caſe, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be remembred above any thing elſe. And truly I cannot but ſmile ſometimes —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Why what is the matter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I was going to ſay (but the very thought of your odd humour hindred me a little) that I cannot but ſmile to my ſelf when I call to mind, how you ſhift your <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> and change your <hi>Maximes,</hi> according to your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. There is no Weathercock more guided by the wind than You are by this. For it was a <hi>Fundamental Maxime,</hi> heretofore, I well remember, and obſtinately maintained among your party, who now fawn and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>That the Law is the Kings Superior: and that he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63803:22"/>hath not ſo much power over it as to be its Supream Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: That his Oath tyes him expreſly to obſerve it; and binds him to ſee it executed.</hi> Upon which ſcore all the Kingdom was filled with loud complaints about the <hi>Non-execution of Laws, and of the Indulgences granted</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons who offended againſt them. For <hi>execution,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>was the Life of the Law, whithout which it became, vain and uſeleſs.</hi> This was the bold Doctrine currant not many years ago, and he was held for a Malignant that did not believe it. But now on a ſudden we hear you ſing a new Song in praiſe of his Majeſties <hi>gracious Indulgence</hi> (for ſo you will call it) and withal you earneſtly deſire the Execution of Laws may ſtill be ſuſpended; that is, ly dead <hi>and become vain and uſeleſs.</hi> For which alteration, I can find no reaſon but this; that now the Indulgence is to your ſelves and then it was to other folk. Then alſo you thought your ſelves able to make the King bow to <hi>you;</hi> and now your Weakneſs forces You to worſhip <hi>him.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Where do you find any ſuch Maximes? For my part I have forgot them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I can ſend you to ſeveral Books where you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh your memory: particularly to the <hi>Medicine for Malignants;</hi> which tells you p. 25. <hi>That the King hath not power over the Law, but the Law over the King.</hi> But for your greater eaſe, I will only refer you to one ſmall Pamphlet called <hi>Known Laws:</hi> in which you ſhall not fail to meet with more than I have ſaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe, I believe, were the Maximes of the <hi>State-faction.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I know no difference between Them and your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in this matter. I am ſure Mr. <hi>Will. Bridges</hi> (who differs from Mr. <hi>Will. Bridge</hi> as little as their Names do) makes none at all. In whom I find a paſſage ſo directly oppoſite to your preſent Opinions about the obligation of the <hi>Oxford Act,</hi> and declaring ſo fully the ſenſe of your
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63803:23"/>Divines about the Kings Power, that I muſt crave leave to mention it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I am content to hear it. But you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that theſe were but the Opinions of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>You are miſtaken. This man made an Anſwer (<hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Authority</hi> 1644.) to a Book called the <hi>Loyal Convert,</hi> in which he tells the converted Gentleman, <hi>that he speaks illegally if he ſay the King can protect a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt any way.</hi> His reaſon is Univerſal, though his Inſtance be Particular; <hi>for whom the Law Protects not, the King either cannot or ought not to protect.</hi> No, he ought not, as he tells us, ſo much as to require the help of ſuch perſons to protect him. <hi>For they ought only to be Tributaries, and to hold themſelves to their</hi> U B I, <hi>to their place,</hi> Which words I would have you apply to that buſineſs which begat this Diſcourſe. I would fain know of your Divines how his Majeſties Power comes to be ſo variable at their pleaſure? Whence is it that He can diſpenſe with <hi>your Reſidence</hi> in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> B I</hi> or place to which you are by the Law confined, who could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe at all <hi>with others,</hi> nor releaſe them (no not for his neceſſary aſſiſtance) from that place to which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Doctrine they were immoveably chain'd. The Law protects both alike; that is, not at all: what is the cauſe then that he can give <hi>you</hi> Protection, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Law; and not <hi>them?</hi> Miſtake me not; it is the fartheſt thing from my thoughts to call in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the extent of his Majeſties Supream Power. I only queſtion your <hi>Principles,</hi> who pretend to be no <hi>Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi> Anſwer me this. If the King have a power to give an Indulgence and diſpenſe with the Law, why did you ſo rudely and barbarouſly clamour againſt him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and ſay the contrary? If he have not, why do you every where ſeek to juſtifie your ſelves in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63803:23"/>your illegal Practices, with a meer ſhaddow and fancy of his Indulgence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>There is a great diſtance of time between the one and the other, and they have changed their minds upon ſecond thoughts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Very likely. And you believe alſo, that if <hi>Presbytery</hi> were in its height and Glory, his Majeſty might diſpence wich the <hi>Laws</hi> of their making, as well as with his own: Do you not? Alas good man! you ſhall find, I doubt, to your coſt, if things were come to that paſs; that no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority could remit the Rigour of them. For they have condemned all Diſpenſations and Licenſes, as Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Their Decrees are ſo ſacred, that as there lyes no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from their Courts, ſo none may take Authority to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxate their Laws. For they take themſelves to ſit in Chriſts Tribunal Seat; and ſo their Laws are no more to be diſpenſed with than his.</p>
               <p>But why do I inſiſt ſo long upon one thing, ſince there are ſo many inſtances of your windings and turnings as your <hi>Intereſt</hi> leads you? There was a time I remember, when the Parliament was magnified as the only <hi>keepers of the Peoples Liberties.</hi> We were told<note n="*" place="margin">Obſervator on his Majeſties Anſwers 1642.</note> 
                  <hi>that we might not ſo much as imagine the Houſes could be injurious; or that a Committee ſhould have any private ends to miſlead them.</hi> And therefore they could nor ſit too long, nor prove a burden to the good people. But now you are quite in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſtrain. There is no greater <hi>grievance</hi> than a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. No more intollerable <hi>miſchief</hi> than their long Continuance. For which different judgment there is no reaſon, that I can ſee, but this; that then the Parliament was <hi>for</hi> you, and now it is <hi>againſt</hi> you. The time was alſo, as I told you before, when the <hi>Commons</hi> alone might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> on all the Subjects, under the Pain of being incapable of any Office, if they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63803:24"/>refuſed it. But now you will be free from all impoſition of this Nature: And an Oath enjoyn'd by the King and both the Houſes, under no ſeverer penalty than a ſmall Reſtraint, is look't upon as a grievous Oppreſſion. There are thoſe likewiſe that can remember when the <hi>Commons</hi> alone put out another Order about ſome of the affairs of Religion: But now a Law enacted by the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is thought an high invaſion of Chriſts Prerogative; and he muſt not meddle in matters of his Worſhip. The reaſon is; any thing may be done by any Body to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance your fancies, but nothing againſt them by no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the World. Nay, we have not forgotten the time when Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> uſed this Argument among others to perſwade the People to take the Covenant,<note n="*" place="margin">Sermons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, p. 64.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe Antichriſt and his faction had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper'd ſo much by entring into Covenants; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People of God ſhould try what this way will do, which hath been ſo advantageous to the enemy. For God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>may make uſe of that Stratagem to ruin their Kingdom, which they uſed to build it.</hi> But now if any of us ſay, that the ſame Perſons have maintain'd a great reverence in the people to their Religion, by many Stately Ceremonies, ſplendid Veſtures, and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Rites, and therefore we may hope to keep the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God from contempt by a few ſolemn and grave Ceremonies, by decent habits, and ſuch rites and geſtures as may beſeem the dignity of our Religion; preſently you raiſe an out-cry againſt us, and the People are told, that we are <hi>Popiſhly affected, of an Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>imitate Idolaters.</hi> For which I can aſſign no cauſe but this; that then the Argument was for <hi>you;</hi> and now it makes for <hi>us.</hi> And you are reſolved to ſerve your ſelves by all means, though it be by approving and anon rejecting the very ſame things.</p>
               <p>If a thing like you well, it ſhall go very hard but you
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63803:24"/>will find ſome Scripture for it. And if none ſpeak plainly, you will torture and draw ſome or other to be on your ſide, and labour to prove that they ſignifie according to your meaning. But if a thing diſlike you, then you ask for plain Scritprue. Nothing will ſatisfie, unleſs we ſhew it you in expreſs terms. It is <hi>Superſtition, Will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> any thing, but good, unleſs we produce a text in ſo, many words to confirm it. Of the ſame ſhifting humour was the late <hi>Army,</hi> as appears by their unparalel'd Story, which in brief is this. On the 20. of <hi>April</hi> 1653. they turn'd their <hi>Maſters,</hi> whom they had long ſerved, out of doors, as a company of <hi>Self-Seekers,</hi> who minded their own <hi>private,</hi> more than the <hi>publick</hi> Good. About ſix years after, <hi>finding the good Spirit declining, which formerly appeared among them, in carrying on the great work</hi> (thoſe are their Canting expreſſions) <hi>and the good old Cauſe it ſelf become a reproach:</hi> they were led to look back and examine the cauſe <hi>of the Lords withdrawing his wonted preſence from them.</hi> And among other things they remembred what Injuries they had done to the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the long Parliament, and <hi>that they were eminent aſſerters of that Cauſe, and had a ſpecial preſence of God with them, and were ſignally bleſſed in that Work.</hi> And therefore invited them by their Declaration of <hi>May</hi> 6. 1659. (in which you may find theſe things,) to come and ſit again; <hi>promiſing to yield their uttermoſt Aſſiſtance for their ſitting in ſafety.</hi> Would you not imagine now that they would for ever reverence theſe <hi>Eminent,</hi> theſe <hi>Bleſſed</hi> men? and that to oppoſe them in their <hi>great work,</hi> would be, in their opinion, to <hi>fight againſt God, to drive away the good Spirit, and to endeavour to deſtroy the Cauſe of God?</hi> And yet it was not long before they were of another mind. They held themſelves, for all this, to be <hi>the greater Saints; the Army of the living God;</hi> and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably ſetled in his favour that they ſhould not loſe it,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63803:25"/>do they what they would. And therefore as ſoon as ever the Parliament refuſed to act according to their mind, they refuſed to yield their obedience. When they voted ſome of their Commiſſions void, and reſolved to govern the Army by Commiſſioners in ſtead of a Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; theſe <hi>late penitents</hi> could ſee nothing of God any longer among them: The ſpecial Preſence of God vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and in a moment diſappeared. So that on the 13th. of the next <hi>October,</hi> they lockt up the doors of the Houſe, ſet themſelves once more above their Maſters; and in an inſolent manner <hi>declared</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Declara. agreed at Wallingford Houſe, Octob. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>all their Orders, Acts, pretended Acts, or Declarations (and all proceedings thereupon had or done) on</hi> Munday <hi>the</hi> 10. <hi>of that Month, and on</hi> Tueſday, <hi>and</hi> Wedneſday <hi>following, null and void to all intents and purpoſes, in as full and ample a manner as if they had been never done.</hi> And immediately after, they pact the Men away after theſe Acts and Orders. Nay, this they did, notwithſtanding that they had ſtiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeveral times, but five dayes before this 10. of <hi>October, Your faithful Servants the Army;</hi> and profeſſed that <hi>having diligently inquired into their hearts and wayes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Humble Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Petit. Octob. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>they found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing among them</hi> but <hi>faithfulneſs and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity to the Parliament;</hi> concluding their addreſs in this manner <hi>that notwithſtanding all endeavours to the contrary, they would by the help of God, be found faithful to them.</hi> Were not theſe <hi>gallant fellows? Wonderful conſtant</hi> to their Principles and Profeſſions? <hi>Mightily overawed by the preſence of God; Single-hearted,</hi> and <hi>faithful to</hi> their word? Yes, by all means, you muſt needs ſay; for of ſuch as theſe a great part of the <hi>Churches of the Saints</hi> is now compoſed. And faithful they were to themſelves; and that was enough. Conſtant to this principle, that they were alway in the right; and what would you have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63803:25"/>more? They could <hi>Cant</hi> ſtill in Scripture language, and therefore God was not withdrawn from them. They could faſt and pray ſtill, and had a power to <hi>turn even the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, into a day of Humiliation;</hi> and therefore the Good Spirit had not forſaken them. They hated <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that is <hi>us;</hi> and were reſolved to burn the fleſh of the Whore with fire, &amp; ſo ſtill remained <hi>the Army of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> For as if they had ſome ſuch work in hand as the Apoſtles had, they call upon all the Godly in the nation to ſay on their behalf, <hi>who are ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> and to cry aloud for them before the Throne of Grace, <hi>that the Lord himſelf would appear, and carry on his work in their hand.</hi> And great reaſon there was to expect it; ſince they had once more injur'd thoſe, who aſſerted his cauſe; and done that very thing, for which (as they ſaid,) he had before withdrawn his wonted preſence from them. O the <hi>Impudent foreheads</hi> of theſe Men! O the <hi>Sottiſhneſs</hi> of the People, that will be ſtill coſened by ſuch like <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters!</hi> Will you never open your eyes and ſee how vain their pretences to the Spirit are? Will you never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of their preſumptuous Boaſtings, and empty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence? Will you ſtill believe that theſe men are highly illuminated, who call that darkneſs, which a little while ago was light; and then croſs themſelves again, and ſay no; it is but Darkneſs? Are theſe the men whom we muſt all follow; who run, we ſee, in an endleſs round of contradicting their own Profeſſions? or muſt we ſhut our eyes, and give them our hand that they may lead us whither they pleaſe? Muſt we forget all that is paſt, and believe they are now poſſeſt with an <hi>infallible Spirit?</hi> This is the thing no doubt, they deſire. We muſt reſign our belief to their Declarations. We muſt allow all their Reaſons and Excuſes, whatſoever they be, We muſt, at leaſt, ſuffer them to juſtifie themſelves by thoſe very things which they formerly condemn'd; and ſay nere a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63803:26"/>word. And then we love them; then we favour the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; then they have ſome hopes of us; and it's poſſible God may have mercy on us, though we be out of the way and do not follow them.</p>
               <p>I know you will ſay, that ſuch as you, are none of the <hi>Army-Saints:</hi> that you condemn their Practices, and hate their leud pretences to Religion as a great ſcandal to it: All which I verily believe. But, let me tell you, the Army had a copy ſet them of unconſtancy and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing by thoſe men whom you admired. For there was a time when the Lords and Commons could ſee ſome good in the <hi>Liturgy and Government of the Church</hi> by Law eſtabliſhed. Nay more than that; they made a Declaration<note n="*" place="margin">April 9. 1642.</note>, cauſed it to be printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in all Market Towns, <hi>That they would take away nothing in the one or the other, but what ſhould be evil and juſtly offenſive, or at leaſt unneceſſary and burdenſome.</hi> And yet when they had more power, they were of another mind. Every thing was offenſive, at leaſt unneceſſary and burdenſome; nothing would ſerve but taking away <hi>all the Common-Prayer;</hi> and plucking up <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> by the very roots. The reaſon, I ſuppoſe, was, becauſe this became as neceſſary to promote their Deſigns in proceſs of time; as that Declaration was at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. If they had reſted there, and gone no farther, they had loſt the hearts of the moſt ſpiritual; who would never have ſeen <hi>ſuch a glorious anointing upon them from the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beam of Light by Ch. Feak.</note> as now appeared. Now they very <hi>fifth kingdom men,</hi> could not but ſee it, and acknowledge it in Print: though it was not long before they alſo chang'd like all the reſt; and had loſt the ſight of this glory, being able to ſpy no <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> any where but upon themſelves. For they helpt to profane the Crown of theſe annointed ones, and caſt out the greateſt part of them, as if they were but ſcum and filth.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63803:26"/>But I think it's beſt to trace your windings and turnings no further; for fear they lead us too far out of the way.</p>

               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>A good Reſolution. <hi>Too much of one thing you know is good for nothing.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>True. And I think the firſt thing I ſaid about your pretences of a tacit Indulgence, is ſufficient to ſhew, that you are perfectly like men in danger of drowning, who catch hold indifferently of what comes next to hand; be it a naked Sword or an hot Iron.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Pray make an end of this: for you have quite tired me with your Diſcourſe. In which you have largely proved the truth of the common talk, that you are of a <hi>barſh, nay a bitter and jeering Spirit,</hi> and was in a chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick mood when you wrote your Book.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Rather, they that ſay ſo, prove what I have been ſaying all this time that they blow hot and cold out of the ſame mouth; and condemn that in <hi>others</hi> which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nay, praiſe in <hi>themſelves.</hi> For you ſhall hear them call that Salt and Smartneſs of wit in one whom they <hi>love;</hi> which is Bitterneſs and jeering in him whom they <hi>hate.</hi> And that paſſes for innocent Mirth and Pleaſantneſs in one of their party; which is Levity and Frothineſs in one of ours. Nay, it is Zeal for God and his cauſe if you ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the faults of other men, or raſhly charge and bring even a falſe Accuſation againſt your Betters: but it is malignity of Spirit, hatred of God and the power of Godlineſs, if we do but tell a plain and true ſtory of your miſcarriages. No man ever oppoſed you reſolutely, but you ſaid he rail'd. No man diſcovered your Partiality and other vices; but you complain'd of his Bitterneſs, and ſaid he was in a rage againſt you. If by this you meant nothing elſe, but that I write with ſome heat and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I would confeſs it, and ſay it is not to be condemn'd. For who can contend coldly and without affection about thoſe things which he holds dear and precious? A Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick perſon indeed may write from his brain (as my <hi>Lord
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63803:27"/>Bacon</hi> I think obſerves) without any touch or ſenſe on his heart; as in a ſpeculation that pertains not to him: But a Feeling Chriſtian will expreſs in his words a Character, either of Zeal or Love; which you know are warm Paſſions. For my part, I think I have expreſſed both, but nothing at all of wrath and bitterneſs. And therefore, as to that cenſure which your Friends paſs on me, I believe he will ſpeak a great deal truer, that affirms the Authors of it were full of choller themſelves. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, they could not but have diſcern'd a charitable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in my writing, and eaſily ſeen, that the Indignation I expreſſed againſt ſome vices, is ſuch as conſiſts with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Meekneſs, and ought not to be condemn'd as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly Paſſion. Do you not find that <hi>Moſes was very wroth,</hi> when Iſrael committed a great ſin? and yet his Meekneſs is commended above all other mens. And what think you of St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he calls the <hi>Galatians</hi> a <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> ſort of people: and plainly tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that he could as well uſe a Rod, as the Spirit of Meekneſs: and bids <hi>Titus,</hi> whom a little before he warn'd againſt raſh anger, to <hi>rebuke</hi> ſome perſons <hi>ſharply?</hi> Nay what think you of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf? was not he angry at the hardneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> heart? <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.5. Was he in any fault when he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>O fools and ſlow of heart to believe?</hi> Undoubtedly I may ſincerely and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love you when I expreſs a juſt Indignation againſt you; and you may as heartily hate me, when you ſeem very gentle and kindly affected toward me. It is poſſible you may have met with this ſaying out of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which is ordinarily cited by our Writers, and worth your conſideration. <hi>It is ſo far from being true, that every one that is angry with others bates them; that ſometimes he who is not angry, is thereby convinced of bearing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt hatred to them.</hi> And this alſo. <hi>I am not to account every one my Friend that ſpares and forbears me;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63803:27"/>nor every one my enemy that ſeverely corrects and laſhes me.</hi> Beſides; there are ſome of ſuch a nature, that nothing but ſharp dealing will do them good. <hi>They are like knotty Blocks, which require more Wedges, and harder blows alſo to drive them home. If he that undertakes</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Corn. Burges</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Fire of the Sanct. unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</note>, once famous among you) <hi>ſhall dally, and not ſtrike home with all his might, he ſhall find the Wedge about his ſhins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They will rage the more confidently when they ſee he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours them: They will think he fears and ſtands in awe of them, and ſo flie in his face with the greater fury. I have never found any thing truer than this; that to ſpeak ſome men fair, is but to make them have a better opinion of themſelves. They never thank you for your gentle and tender uſage; for they imagine their Merit extorts it from you. Whatſoever Favour you ſhew them, it is not imputed to your <hi>kindneſs,</hi> but their own <hi>deſervings:</hi> and they perk up the higher in their own Conceit, becauſe you have ſuch regard to them. That they may know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therefore; they muſt not be ſtroaked, but ſmitten; you muſt not gently jogg, but roughly ſhake them; if you intend to awaken them. If you would not have them ſooth themſelves up in their ſins; you muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly detect and diſcover them. If you would have them ſee the greatneſs of their Offences, you muſt boldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, and tear in pieces all their pretences and excuſes whereby they ſeek to hide them. And as long as you are truly charitable, and allow all that is good in them; they may ſee, if they be not perfectly blinded with a too fond Love of themſelves, that you are a <hi>Friend</hi> to them, though an <hi>enemy</hi> to their vices. For (to uſe the words of a famous Writer) as the coldeſt and fierceſt winds are obſerved to grow mild and gentle by paſſing through temperate Regions, ſo do ſevere &amp; ſharp Reproofs pertake of the nature of him that gives them,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63803:28"/>and loſe part of their Auſterity when they are managed with Prudence and charity.</p>
               <p>It is a very good Old ſaying, <hi>Love thy Neighbor, yet pull not down thy hedge.</hi> We will be kind to you, but yet make you to know your Bounds. We will not ſuffer you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs to your party, the name and reputation of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. You ſhall not paſs for the only nice and tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienc'd men, nor be thought more Conſcientious than you are. Nor will we ſuffer you if we can help it, to pull down the Fence that is about our Church; thoſe wiſe and wholſom Laws that are made for its Safety and Security. Too much <hi>civility</hi> to you, doth but make you <hi>preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> You only take Occaſion to grow more bold and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious; if in ſome things we commend your ſtrictneſs, but wink at your faults. And therefore we muſt tell you your own (as we commonly ſpeak) and let the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded people know, how Ignorant, how Superſtitious, how Defective you are in a great number of Chriſtian duties; whilſt you imagine your ſelves the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt holy people in the world. If you be angry at this and call it bitterneſs, it is no more than I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from many of you. <hi>For a gall'd horſe,</hi> I know, <hi>loves not to be curried, and a guilty conſcience loves not to bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi> Let us go about the one or the other with never ſo much caution, they will be ſure to winch. Though the neceſſity be great and our charity much, it is all one; they have no mind to be touched. Now how neceſſary and ſeaſonable thoſe Inſtructions were that I gave you, I leave others to judge who are <hi>impartial.</hi> And as for the manner of delivering them; ſhew me any thing in my Book that bites, but only Truth; and I will knock out its teeth: Which if you think I have ſharpned too much; I aſſure you, it was only to give you a quicker ſenſe of your Errors. All the Salt you may fanſie in it, was intended only to <hi>ſeaſon</hi> you, but not to <hi>fret</hi> you at all.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:63803:29"/>of your Authors. Firſt, there is a Book intitled <hi>A looking glaſs for Malignants,</hi> writ by one of your ancient Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Mr. <hi>Vicars;</hi> the famous Author of your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Chronicle, called, <hi>God in the Mount,</hi> In which he treats our Clergy and people with the wonted civilities, that your rude People now beſtow upon us. He begins with the Archb. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whom he calls a <hi>Curſt cow,</hi> dr <hi>rather a rageing fat Bull of</hi> Baſhan: <hi>whoſe heart,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>was more hard and Adamantine than a nether Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and moſt extreamly cauteriz'd, yea ſtigmatiz'd with the hotteſt Iron of moſt deſperate Impenitency.</hi> And having thus expreſſed his reſpects and charity to him; then he greets our inferiour Miniſters by the name of <hi>Baal-Prieſts, Popiſh ſons of Belial:</hi> and makes it an admirable piece of Divine Providence, <hi>that the Souldiers who went againſt</hi> Scotland (before our Wars) <hi>ſhould have their hearts over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by God, and their Spirits ordered to plunder and terrify thoſe ſcandalous Baal-Prieſts.</hi> As for the People that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the King, he calls them <hi>Marble-hearted Malignants, implacable and inveterate haters of Holyneſs; that were for meer formal Proteſt antiſm at large, which is in effect down right Atheiſm.</hi> This excellent Treatiſe was licenſed by Mr. <hi>John White</hi> who was himſelf ſuch another Reviler; and called our Miniſters by the ſame names; nay far worſe: not only <hi>Prieſts of Baal,</hi> but of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apus.</hi> And though you may imagine he ſpeaks only of thoſe particular men whom he put into his <hi>Centuries,</hi> He will inform you otherwiſe if you look into his Epiſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt of them. Which he put forth, as he tells us, for this end <hi>that the World might ſee what manner of perſons our Clergy be.</hi> As if there was no difference; but the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were to judge of all the reſt, by thoſe ſtories which were told of ſome. And truly, ſo they did, and ſo they do to this day.</p>

               <p>I never obſerved theſe things. But you muſt conſider
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63803:29"/>that this <hi>Vicars</hi> was old, and ſo might be teſty: For no man well adviſed ſure would approve of that diſorderly action of the Souldiers, much leſs make God the Author of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> I remember indeed Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. Edw.

But as for that action of the rude Souldiers, I remember very well, it is applauded by M. <hi>Caſe</hi> in a Book licenſed by the ſame Mr. <hi>White June 27.</hi> 1642. call'd <hi>Gods waiting to be gracious,</hi> &amp;c. Where he makes this one of their Incouragements to expect the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe <hi>God had ſo wonderfully wrought upon the Spirits of men, particularly on thoſe ſouldiers, who went,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>to fight the Biſhops battles in</hi> Scotland; <hi>that they pull'd down the Railes, Threatned the Prieſts, and kept ſuch a Viſitation in their progreſs, as the Biſhops hardly ever had done ſince Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>dayes.</hi> This he ſaith, p. 119. was the <hi>Finger of God, the work of him that created the Spirit of man.</hi>

               <p>It's very ſtale. But no news at all to us who are well acquainted with their pitiful way of arguing. And I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh your Miniſters would ſeriouſly conſider, upon this occaſion, theſe two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> how wretchedly they were wont to reaſon, and how they abuſed the poor people by incouraging them to draw the <hi>greateſt hopes</hi> from the <hi>ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt grounds.</hi> For what Connexion is there between theſe two things? The diſorderly Souldiers were uncivil to our Miniſters, and prophaned our Churches as they went into the North, therefore the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> is near at hand? It is juſt like the reaſoning of Mr. <hi>Henderſon</hi> who told the Parliament that the <hi>Faſt</hi> which they kept on St <hi>Johns</hi> day<note n="*" place="margin">Sermon on 27.

               <p>As it hath done already: and ſo diffuſed its venome among your people, that they are generally infected with this Plague. Nay, they not only do ſuch things themſelves, but take pleaſure in them that do them. Witneſs all the filthy reproaches they beſtow upon our Divine Service, Clergy, and People: and the great ſatisfaction and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe wherewith the late <hi>Cobler of Gloceſters</hi> writings were entertained, even by thoſe whom you eſteem Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. This ſhews what manner of ſpirit you are of, and that your people are in danger to deprive themſelves of all ſenſe of true Religion: to pave their own hearts, and make them like the high-way; through which all things may paſs without any difference (ſave only a few inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ceremonies) even whole <hi>Cart-loads</hi> of dung and filth. And of the very ſame ſpirit, I muſt tell you, this ſort of Religious people have ever been. For <hi>Martin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelate,</hi> with whoſe Devil this man was poſſeſſed; was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the like Applauſe, and his Writings ſo thumb'd, <hi>that they were even worn out, with continual read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and handling of them.</hi> If you will not believe me; yet I hope you will truſt Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> whoſe words theſe are; as you may ſee if you look into his Comments on the 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>p.</hi> 49. of the Engliſh Edit. where ſpeaking of the Nakedneſs of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> in his opinion, the <hi>Church of England</hi>) he makes this an Argument of it, that this man had poured ſuch great contempt and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reproach upon it, which is the meaning of her being <hi>Naked. There was one,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that called himſelf by the name of Mar-prelate, who ſet forth a Book wherein he dealt ſomewhat roundly with the Angel. How were thoſe bitter jeſts of his favoured among the People? How plauſible were they in a manner to all men? How wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and greedily; with what great mirth were they every
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63803:32"/>where entertained? There is none ſo rude and unskilful but pondering that time in his mind, would ſay thus to himſelf, and that not without cauſe; Truly, the Lord hath poured out contempt upon Princes; thoſe that honour him doth he honour, and thoſe that deſpiſe him, ſhall be deſpiſed. He hath made our Prieſts contemptible to the whole People, becauſe they have broken their Covenant.</hi> You may read what follows there if you think good: For it is a great Demonſtration, how well thoſe people were inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and what rare deviſes you have been taught to blind your eyes that you may not ſee your ſins. For you may <hi>ſpeak evil;</hi> and <hi>rejoyce in iniquity;</hi> and ſport your ſelves in <hi>beholding your Fathers Nakedneſs;</hi> and fancy all the time that you are <hi>fulfilling Propheſies, executing the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment written; and pouring out Vials,</hi> like ſo many Angels.</p>

               <p>And a Devil it was, whom when you had once raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you could never conjure down again; nor with all your Prayers and Faſtings diſpoſſeſs him. Nay, this foul Spirit grew in time ſo outragious that he flew at laſt in a foaming manner in your own face. Which is a thing ſo remarkable, that I cannot but put you in mind of it: how you were ſerved in your kind; and felt the tongues of men ſharpned againſt your ſelves, which you had whetted to wound the reputation of others. No ſooner had you pull'd down the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whom you had laid low before by ſuch fellows as that <hi>Martin-Mar-prelate:</hi> but out comes <hi>Martins Eccho</hi> which return'd all thoſe Reproaches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Presbytery. <hi>Baal, Babylon, Egypt,</hi> and all the reſt of thoſe Heatheniſh names were preſſed to war againſt <hi>you,</hi> which you had made to ſerve againſt <hi>us. Presbytery</hi> was called a <hi>Limb of Antichriſt: a tyrannical Lordly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a worſe bondage than that under the Biſhops; a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under Taskmaſters, like thoſe over Iſrael in Egypt.</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:63803:32"/>Nay that Very Mouth which reviled our Church, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled your intended Reformation. Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> himſelf, whom your people had ſo much admired, and brought home with ſuch joy and triumph, that you fancied (as I ſhall tell you before we have done) that day to be the <hi>Reſurrection of the Witneſſes;</hi> beſtowed thoſe cenſures on Presbyterial Government: which he ſaid<note n="*" place="margin">Dialogue called Conformity, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</note> 
                  <hi>would bring us under perpetual ſlavery, worſe than either Egypt or Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the very ſame terms wherein you had rail'd againſt our <hi>Prieſts,</hi> we heard the Sectaries railing againſt your <hi>Presbyters:</hi> whom they called <hi>Romiſh bloody Prieſts, Black Coats, Diviners and Soothſayers; Croaking Frogs; the Devils Agents; Penſioners to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of the Brethren.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> it ſelf we were told <hi>had two horns like a Lamb, but a mouth like a Dragon, teaching the Parliament to ſpeak blaſphemy againſt the Saints that dwell in Heaven.</hi> Your <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> alſo was as much diſgraced as ours, and ſtiled <hi>the Burden of the Saints, the bondage of the Church, the ſtraightning of the Spirit, the limiting of Chriſt;</hi>

                  <hi>and the ecclipſing of the glory of the Father.</hi> Nay it is pretty to obſerve, how the very <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> you had ſo long complain'd on, was now found working among you. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> ſaid, was a piece of it. And Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> (in his Epiſtle before his Sermon <hi>of Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> preached before the Parliament) calls Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <hi>a new form of that myſtery of iniquity, which had been ſo long a working.</hi> The Beaſt, they held, had only chang'd its ſhape, and taken another name, and ſo they baited it moſt fiercely as you had taught them: And told you in effect, what the Proverb ſays, <hi>that Gooſe, and Gander, and Goſling, are three ſounds, but one thing.</hi> But they would not part with you thus; for after they had done with this, then they fell upon your darling, <hi>the Solemn League and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63803:33"/>Covenant.</hi> This became <hi>a brand of infamy, a Cains mark almoſt</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> tells us<note n="*" place="margin">Thankſg. Serm. for taking of Cheſter. p. 26.</note>) <hi>ſo that if they would ſtigmatize a man to purpoſe, they would ſay, He? He is a Covenanter.</hi> As you had told <hi>us</hi> that we made an Idol of the <hi>Common-Prayer;</hi> ſo Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> told <hi>you</hi> publickly in a Sermon at the <hi>three Cranes,</hi> that you <hi>kept ſuch a ſtir about the Covenant, as if you would have the people make an Idol of it.</hi> Mr. <hi>Feak</hi> alſo called it, the <hi>great Idol of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</hi> And ſo fit had this word been found to do ſervice that at laſt one told us, that you had got <hi>two Idols for on one.</hi> For the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> ſaid an<note n="*" place="margin">Letter to Card.

It comes to my mind alſo, how you who joyn'd in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes againſt <hi>Malignants,</hi> were numbred in concluſion, among them, and ſaid to be grown indeed to a more <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Malignancy;</hi> but that there was no greater difference between a <hi>Presbyter</hi> and a <hi>Prelate,</hi> than between a half Crown piece, and two ſhillings and ſix pence. And as your good friend Mr. <hi>Vicars</hi> had told us, that God had made us to be <hi>the very drudges and Scul-boyes of his Church and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> in good time told you (in a Pamphlet of his) that the <hi>Presbyterians were no better than Gibeonites, who might help to hew ſtone and ſquare Timber for a more glorious building.</hi>

               <p>You muſt let me remember you what a mighty cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor you raiſed againſt the Biſhops, as if they had been ſo many <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> that perſecuted Gods <hi>Iſaacs:</hi> and you have not forgot ſure how oft you were called your ſelves, <hi>the Carnal ſeed, the fleſhly children; the perſecuters of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63803:33"/>of the free woman.</hi> For your Miniſters that accuſed the Biſhops (and made it a main part of their <hi>Remonſtrance to the houſe of Commons</hi> in the beginning of the Wars) that they had put ſome who were but Serving-men into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and made them Miniſters: ſaw in a little time a whole ſwarm of vile creatures (nothing ſo good as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-men) making themſelves Miniſters, and ſetting up for the moſt Goſpel-preachers. And there was no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but all their preaching and printing, and petitioning againſt it was deſpiſed. Theſe taught the people to call them <hi>blind Guides,</hi> as they had taught them to call our <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Nay, their Maſters at laſt incouraged and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſcoffs of thoſe that ſaid, <hi>Theſe blind Guides travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they thought to Sion, are faln into the ditch in the Iſle of Wight. Inſatiable hirelings, Gehazi's, cheaters, pulpited Divines,</hi> and a great lurry of ſuch like names were libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dealt to them; as you may ſee, if you will not believe me, in their own complaint, called <hi>A Seaſonable Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> p. 11. Nay, the Army it ſelf which had been ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in all this wickedneſs, and magnified by theſe revilers as the <hi>Army of the Lamb;</hi> at laſt heard themſelvs called, the <hi>Abomination of Deſolation.</hi> All which I mention only for this end: to ſhew what your Miniſters got by inſtructing the people in this eaſie Art of diſgracing all they diſlik'd, with the names of <hi>Antichriſtian, Babyloniſh</hi> and ſuch like. As they had done, ſo they were requited. And while the Epiſcopal Clergy ſilently bore the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſins; they that had caſt out their names as abominable, were whipt with their own rods. When they thought <hi>to reign as kings without us;</hi> immediately they were aſſaulted <hi>as Egyptian Tyrants:</hi> when they expected all ſhould bow to the <hi>Scepter of Chriſt in their hand,</hi> they ſaw men riſing up againſt them as <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> Thoſe that had heard their Invectives againſt us, imploy'd them againſt themſelves. And all the Dung they had laid at our
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63803:34"/>doors, was flung by thoſe that had been their followers, in their own faces. If I were indued with the Spirit of Mr. <hi>Vicars,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Caſe,</hi> I ſhould have ſaid upon this occaſion. <hi>Behold the finger of God! the Work of him that created the Spirit of man! See how the Lord over-ruled mens hearts; and ordered their Spirits to terrifie theſe Presbyters.</hi> Or Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> would have taught me to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made your Prieſts contemptible to the whole people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have broken their Covenant.</hi> But I dare not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their boldneſs, nor talk as if I was <hi>infallible.</hi> I will let them enjoy this particular gift to themſelves, of knowing what God doth upon the ſpirits of men. For my part, I think they might be able to ſay all this, even without any extraordinary help of the Devil. There was no need that <hi>Beelzebub</hi> ſhould come to inſpire them with this fury: For they were already poſſeſſed with a mighty Rage. That Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which ſpoke out of the Preſs and Pulpit, had abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſh't them with this <hi>powerful and taking Rhetorick.</hi> And if Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> had lived to that day; he would have wondred to ſee, how near of kin his Heat was to this Fire. Nay, he would have been aſhamed of his rare way of reaſoning againſt our Church, when he had heard ſome retort his words againſt us, upon the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> (I mean <hi>Diſciplinarians</hi>) ſaying; <hi>Truly, the Lord hath powred contempt upon Princes: Thoſe that honour him, doth he honour; and thoſe that deſpiſe him ſhall be deſpiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus I have at laſt opened this rotten <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> (I hope you will not be angry if I uſe his words<note n="*" place="margin">In 3.

But if the evil ſhall be only ſtirred up, and the handling of it ſhall offend the ſick and ſore parties; I will yet comfort my ſelf with the conſcience of the good diſcharge of my Duty, and with the ordinary reward of a Phyſician.</hi>

               <p>To their Schiſmatical ſpirit you ſhould have ſaid.

                  <note place="margin">Pref. to Antapolog.</note> 
                  <hi>I had out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and love to ſome of them, forborn to ſay any thing of theſe matters.</hi> 
                  <q>And therefore let not my Book by reaſon of its truth and plainneſs be branded for a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, railing and malitious Writing: But let them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they need ſuch a Book as doth not flatter and extol them, but be plain and free with them. For the truth is (as he goes on) they have been too much flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, both in their Perſons and Churches; and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for want of being plainly and freely dealt withal.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63803:35"/>A Candle hath been too long held to them; I hope my Book may do them much good, to abate their ſwelling and confidence. And if many of our Miniſters would deal more plainly with them, it would be better both for them and us.</q> I remember a paſſage concerning <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in an Epiſtle of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s to <hi>Melancthon</hi> (they are ſtill the ſame mans words) which the perſons being changed, may be fitly applied to my purpoſe. <hi>If there were that mind in us all, that ought to be; perhaps ſome remedy might be found. And certainly we tranſmit an unworthy Example to poſterity, while we caſt away all liberty, rather than offend a few men: Will not their vehemency riſe and grow the more, while all bear with them, and ſuffer all things from them?</hi> Undoubtedly it will. Our baſe ſilence doth but make them open their mouths wider to declaim againſt us. We cheriſh their inſolent behaviour while we make no Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and give no check to their violence. They imagine we allow them to be ſo worthy as they fancy themſelves, while we ſit ſtill, and only ſee and hear their Folly. And therefore to ſhew that we know them, not that we hate them, I took the Freedom to write thoſe things which you accuſe of Malice.</p>

                  <hi>and ſavour not the things of God.</hi> They are the words of Mr. <hi>Paul Bains,</hi> approved by no leſs man than Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> who is pleaſed to add in his great modeſty, <hi>that there was as much agreement between them in their management of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (except two or three) and their powerful Preachers, as between the light which comes down from Heaven, and that thick miſt which ariſes from the loweſt pit.</hi> And <hi>that there is more of God and his Religion in ſome one congregation of a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd Miniſter, than in all the Biſhops families in England.</hi> I appeal to all the world whether I had not reaſon to ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack theſe proud vaunts, and ſcornful ſpeeches.

               <p>They ſhould have thankt me for that. And might have ſeen if they pleaſed, by that <hi>moderation,</hi> that I was not deſirous to publiſh their ſhame more than needs: but ſtudied their amendment by diſcloſing a little of their folly and concealing the reſt. If they will not believe but that I did my worſt, and revealed all I knew; let them but ſignify this diſtruſt of my Charity, and I ſhall give them abundant ſatisfaction. Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> I am ſure hath no cauſe to complain, who with ſo much labour brings forth childiſh fancies, and is ſo curious to ſpeak abſurdly, and takes ſo much care to avoid ſerious and ſolid ſenſe in the moſt weighty Arguments, that his great Pains is conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in theſe Defects. Of this I did but give a ſmall taſt, and that, not out of the worſt of his conceits; which he ought to look upon as the Civility of a Friend, and not as the want of skill in an enemy. As for Mr. <hi>W. B.</hi> I confeſs ingenuouſly, I ſaid a little the more of him, becauſe you have been too long gull'd by ſuch pretenders to Myſteries and Spirituality. Yet I do not think I ſaid enough, but ought to have told you plainly, that he is <hi>one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Impoſtors</hi> that have perverted the <hi>Truth</hi> as it is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and adulterated the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in this Nation. He ſpoiles almoſt all the Holy Scripture he meddles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and turns it into an idle tale of theſe times, and makes it ſay whatſoever it pleaſes him and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes to hear. Which when I ſeriouſly conſider, I cannot but ſay with a little alteration as one doth, on another occaſion, to his Countreymen. <q>That it is a ſhame there are laws againſt thoſe who counterfeit Coynes, and falſify Merchandizes; yet ſuch are permitted who Sophiſticate our Divinity, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63803:36"/>the Holy Scriptures, and turn our Religion into a new fancy and device of their own. The late <hi>great Plague</hi> is but of ſmall conſideration in compare with this miſchief; and if ſpeedy order be not taken, the multiplying of ſuch Authors will make a <hi>Library</hi> as big as <hi>London,</hi> wherein there ſhall ſcarcely be found one wiſe Sentence, or reaſonable Conceit.</q>

               <p>It's thought Sir by ſome that you are much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in making him the Author of that Book which you reprove, ſince it bears only the two firſt Letters of Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> his name. And I have heard you blam'd for charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with thoſe things which he hath not own'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I think rather thoſe <hi>Apologiſts</hi> are miſtaken. For why doth he not diſown it, if it be not his Book; ſince it contains ſuch dangerous things? Or why did not the Preface to another Book, ſince ſtoln into the world and carrying his name in the front of it, inform us that this was <hi>genuine,</hi> and the other <hi>Spurious?</hi> But if he had, there are very few that would have believ'd him. For they are as like each other, as two pieces of Cloth, that are of the ſame Wool, the ſame thred, the ſame colour, working and bredth. There is the very ſame Canting in both; the ſame abuſe of Holy Scripture, the ſame Spiritual pride and contempt of others, the ſame evil ſpeaking and ſeditious Doctrines; and in one word, <hi>the way and Spirit of</hi> Mr. Bridge.</p>

               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you jeer? I know you allude to the Title of one of thoſe Ten Sermons, which he calls, <hi>The Way and Spirit of the New Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I do ſo: And am better able to deſcribe his Way and Spirit than he to ſet out that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>I think you had better forbear ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Pray let me try a little. It will both divert us a while, and not prove unprofitable. Turn I pray you to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63803:37"/>the <hi>fifth Sermon,</hi> at your leiſure; and tell me when you have compar'd our Conceits,<note place="margin">P. 371. &amp;c.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us do better.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, <hi>the way and Spirit of</hi> Mr. Bridge, <hi>is not</hi> (as he would have it) <hi>a Childlike, but a Childiſh Spirit.</hi> A way and Spirit that hath nothing manly; nothing of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſtian ſenſe and Spirit in it: but abounds with Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, trifling obſervations, and perpetual Tautologies: And yet thinks it ſelf moſt gorgeouſly bedeck't with <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Truths, Diſpenſations, Manifeſtations, Diſcoveries,</hi> and I know not how many other glorious things beſides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is not a <hi>fearing,</hi> but a <hi>fearleſs Spirit;</hi> dareing to talk of God &amp; our Saviour in the boldeſtand rudeſt terms, taking a kind of Pride in inventing new and monſtrous Expreſſions; and ſpiritualizing Religion into airy fancies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The way and Spirit of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not an <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but a Non-ſenſical Spirit.</hi> An inſtance of which is this, that it hath no certain rule whereby to meaſure the love of God. But ſometimes it made ſucceſſes a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods regard to them; and now it tells us that the Croſſes are a mark of it, and that the Children of God muſt be perſecuted by the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The way and Spirit of Mr. <hi>B. is to trade much, or moſt, or altogether with fancies and Dreams.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>Pray do not ſay ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>You may put it in other words if you pleaſe, and ſay it trades <hi>with abſolute Promiſes.</hi> But that's the ſame; for they are no better than dreams and fancies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In the old time men <hi>examined and conſidered what they believed; and came to Faith by rational diſcourſe;</hi> But now in the dayes of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Men are taught to believe they know not why, and <hi>Reaſon is decryed as an enmity to the things of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> In the old times Chriſtians were of a <hi>modeſt and humble Spirit;</hi> but <hi>the way of</hi> Mr. B. <hi>is to teach them
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63803:37"/>to be high and confident;</hi> and to imagine great Diſcoveries and Revelations to be made to them. And therefore they wrong'd Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> very much, when they ſaid his <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graena</hi> was full of lies, becauſe he told ſtrange ſtories of men that pretended to have had <hi>Revelations,</hi> and ſeen <hi>Viſions:</hi> for we find Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> In the old time Humility, Purity, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Charity were held to be things moſt dear to God; but now in the way and Spirit of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> we can hear no tidings of them. For he can tell us but of three things that are dear to him, His <hi>People,</hi> his <hi>Truth,</hi> and his <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> Theſe are his <hi>Plate,</hi> his <hi>fewels,</hi> his <hi>Treaſure,</hi> as I told you the laſt time out of one of his <hi>Ten Serm.</hi> But you muſt know it is not a new diſcovery, but an old and darling Notion of his; which I find in his Sermon before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, 29. <hi>Nov.</hi> 1643. There he tells us, <hi>Three things God loves more ſpecially; His People, his Truth, and his worſhip.</hi> And it is a beloved conceit I perceive among the party; for one of his Brethren delivered it to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before him, &amp; told them in a perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory manner, excluding all other things,<note place="margin">Mr. Tho. Goodwins ſerm. of Apr. 27. 1642. p. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath but three things dear to him in the World; the Saints, his Worſhip, and his Truth.</hi> But which of theſe he loves beſt he could not tell; <hi>for God therefore ordained Saints to be in the World that he might be Worſhip't; and appointed Ordinances of Worſhip, as means to build up his Saints.</hi> Some honeſt old Chriſtian would have told this great Divine if he had heard him; you trouble your ſelf, Sir, about needleſs Queſtions: There is ſomething God loves better than all theſe, <hi>viz. Holines,</hi> &amp; all <hi>Moral vertue.</hi> For in truth there are no <hi>Saints</hi> or people of God (but only in name) without theſe. Take away theſe, and the moſt Orthodox Notions that can be in your head, will make you no better than a Devil. Nor will the exacteſt worſhip, according to the pureſt Ordinances,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63803:38"/>fail to be an Abomination to the Lord, if theſe be abſent. But I forget my ſelf. The way and Spirit of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not to talk of any thing elſe, but <hi>pure Worſhip, pure Ordinances, Goſpel Adminiſtrations,</hi> and ſuch like matters; upon the account of which they eſteem themſelves more holy, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Evangelical than other men. And be they never ſo bad; all's one for that. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath a rule which is very comfortable;<note n="*" place="margin">Sinfuln. of Sin. p. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Humble your ſelves for ſin though it be never ſo ſmall; but do not queſtion your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for any ſin, though it be never ſo great.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will ſay, I do not underſtand him: and truly that's no ſuch great wonder: For, <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Whereas in the old time men wrote and ſpoke ſo, that one might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what they meant; the way and Spirit of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is quite contrary, which is to ſpeak that which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I believe, doth not underſtand. Witneſs ſeveral things I could ſhew you in his <hi>Firſt</hi> of the <hi>Ten Sermons,</hi> concerning <hi>Love to Chriſts perſonal excellencies, without reſpect to his benefits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this, <hi>Ninthly,</hi> In old time they gave good proof for what they ſaid; but the way and Spirit of Mr. <hi>B. is, to put us off with a louſy Similitude or two;</hi> by which he doth all his feats.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you ſpeak in this manner?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I have good reaſon for that Epithite, but now it is time to make an end. And to ſay no more but this, in the old time the way was to demonſtrate things either from their Cauſes, or from their Effects, or from Teſtimony, according as the matter would bear: but now <hi>it is much, or moſtly, or altogether the way of</hi> Mr. B. <hi>to make a compariſon, and find out ſome pitiful reſemblance,</hi> which paſſes for a good reaſon of what he ſayes, with the men of his way and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Ex. g.</hi> to prove that an unconverted man cannot know how full of ſin he is, he will tell you the reaſon is <hi>becauſe his Hoops are on.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sinfuln. of Sin. p. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>As a veſſel that is full
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63803:38"/>of liquour, and the liquor iſſues through the Hoops; you ſee there is liquor in it, but you do not know how full it is, till the hoops are knocked off: but then you will ſay, O how full was this Veſſel? Ah now our hoops are on, and it doth not yet appear how full of ſin men are; only it comes iſſuing through the hoops, through their duties; but a Day is coming when all our hoops ſhall be knocked off, and then it will appear how full, of ſin men are.</hi> Thus he argues excellently from the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril;</hi> and at another time you ſhall find him as good in his reaſons taken from another liquor in a <hi>braſs pan</hi> or pot. For to prove that ſome mens little ſufferings may amount to much, whereas other mens great ſufferings may amount to little, he can give you no other Reaſon <hi>but that God hath a very gracious allowance for his people;</hi> a little will content him from them whom he loves. For which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Commendations beſtowed on the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> though he was impatient:<note n="*" place="margin">Firſt and laſt in ſuff. work. p. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>True,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but God did not meaſure</hi> Job <hi>in his wallops, but when he was cold.</hi> As <hi>we do not meaſure milk when it wallops and ſeeths, but when it is cold</hi> —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Good Sir, have done with this; for it is but the ſame that you ſaid before in the former particular, when you told me of his ſimilitudes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That's very true. But this is ſtill the way and Spirit of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to ſay the ſame thing over again in a new faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as the old ſaying was, <hi>to ſerve up one joynt, in a dozen or two of diſhes.</hi> But to give you a full meaſure, I will put another in the room of that. There was a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Spirit in the ancient times; but the way and Spirit of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Fie for ſhame. That's the thing he charges on you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I know it very well. But ſetting aſide the Papiſts and a few others,<note place="margin">Compare with his Ten. Serm. p. 370.</note> who ſo guilty of it as himſelf? For it is Antichriſtian to reproach our Church as he doth. It is Antichriſtian to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63803:39"/>condemn the preſent worſhip of God among us, and call it Antichriſtian. To decry an outward glorious Worſhip as he makes bold to do, is Antichriſtian. It is Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to oppoſe all degrees of men in the Church; it being plain that there were Apoſtles, Evangeliſts and Prophets ordain'd by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as there were high Prieſts, Prieſts and Levites ordain'd by <hi>Moſes.</hi> It is Antichriſtian to call white Garments legal and Antichriſtian. In ſhort, a furious, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, ſchiſmatical Spirit, I am ſure you will grant, is an Antichriſtian Spirit, and ſuch is the Spirit of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as I will evidently prove.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>There is nothing more eaſie, as you will ſoon ſee, if you look but into his Sermon <hi>of the Two Witneſſes,</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his name to it. In which you may read the danger we all are in, if his <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi> be true. For having told us, plainly enough, that ſuch as he and their followers are the Witneſſes, who <hi>receive their Orders to propheſie from Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, not from men, from the Prelates, from the Beaſt:</hi> then he proceeds to let us know what power they have;<note place="margin">V. pag. 123. of that Book lately prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 1668. called Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Truths, &amp;c.</note> which to omit the reſt, is twofold and much to be obſerved. Firſt, to <hi>ſhut the Heavens that they ſhall not rain, Rev.</hi> 11.6. that is, ſaith he, <hi>to reſtrain the higheſt powers in Church and State, from their wonted influence,</hi> which can have no other ſenſe than this; that they ſhall be ſo powerful as to bind the hands of their Governors, and ty them up from being able to act. And then <hi>Secondly, They ſhall have power over the waters to turn them into blood,</hi> that is, <hi>to turn the ſtill people of a State or Nation into war and blood.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Surely they have no ſuch Orders from Jeſus Chriſt; nor will he ever give men ſuch power as this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That's nothing. They may take this Power, though he do not give it them. For he tells you, <hi>This
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63803:39"/>may be done, though not legally.</hi> For the proof of which, he bids you obſerve, that though it be ſaid <hi>he will give them power to propheſie;</hi> it is not ſaid he <hi>will give them,</hi> but <hi>they ſhall have power,</hi> to ſhut heaven, and turn the waters into blood. That is, give ſuch orders to themſelves, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this Authority; for he repeats it again, <hi>It may be this may be done, and not legally.</hi> What though the Laws of, God and man command us to obey Magiſtrates, not to govern them; to live in peace and quiet and not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the publick tranquility: That's a ſmall matter with theſe men, who fancying they have received a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to propheſy, may inlarge it a little further on their own heads, and <hi>ſhut</hi> up, or impriſon the higher powers that they ſhall not act; and then put the people into a commotion that they may fiſh in the troubled waters. <hi>And whenſoever you ſee theſe things come to paſs, as he tells you; when you ſee the Witneſſes have power to reſtrain the higheſt powers in Church and State from their wonted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; and that they have power to turn the ſtill Nations into war, (and ſo they themſelves are ſlain for the preſent) then you may lift up your heads and comfortably ſay. Now is our Salvation near; For God will bring near his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and his Salvation ſhall not tarry.</hi>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Take it as you will, theſe things are near; if he may be believed, and will not tarry. The influence of the Higher powers he imagines, I conceive, are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy very much reſtrain'd: There wants nothing but the troubling of the quiet and ſtill people that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them more powerfully: and that may ſoon be effected, if his doctrine be received.</p>

               <p>Not in expreſs words, he is wiſer than ſo; but it's the plain ſenſe of his Diſcourſe. For he tells you the 1260 years of their propheſying in ſackcloth began about the year 400. <hi>and therefore ſurely the end of the time we muſt needs be about;</hi> as his words are <hi>p.</hi> 114. Now if you mark what they are to do toward the end of the time; you will ſee it as plain as the noſe on my face, that he thinks we muſt needs be about the time of ſhutting the Heavens and turning the waters into blood.</p>

               <p>We are paſt the time, my good Friend, for if we add 1260. to 400. the year when they ended their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie was 1660. O how glad I am that he was miſtaken. I hope we ſhall have no wars nor tumults; and that God will open theſe mens eyes to ſee their errors; ſince no powers were then reſtrain'd, but thoſe that would have kept <hi>the King</hi> from his throne, to which he was reſtored in <hi>that happy year.</hi>

               <p>You are an honeſt hearted man I ſee? which makes you leſs ſuſpect the craft of others. There's one word in his diſcourſe which you do not obſerve, <hi>viz. thereabout.</hi> That ſalves the buſineſs, and ſerves him for a little while. For he tells you the 1260. years might begin in 406. or 410. after our Saviours Birth. If you take the former num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then the propheſying in ſackcloth ended in 1666. the year when they expected ſuch great matters, that ſome confidently cryed to the people out of the Pulpits (before they left them) <hi>Be patient. for</hi> 1666. <hi>will make a mends for all.</hi> But it failing their expectation and producing nothing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their mind; that's the reaſon I conceive why he hath ſince that, put in the year 410. for the beginning of the years 1260. and ſo adjourns us for their ending to 1670. which is now approaching. Then no doubt he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies the Witneſſes muſt be ſlain (when they have firſt troubled us) and after three years and a half riſe again.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63803:40"/>For he asks his people, <hi>p.</hi> 115. <hi>If Chriſts Witneſſes ſhall lie in ſackcloth</hi> 1260. <hi>years, will not you be contented to be in ſackcloth three or four years? Christians will you not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be in ſackcloth three or four years?</hi> And in the next page after tells them, <hi>Why now, according to the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, there is not much time to come. There is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time of ſackcloth to come. Shall we not watch with him, one hour, and wear ſackcloth with him one hour? Wait a while and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry,</hi> And then he tells them they ſhall wear <hi>white robes,</hi> and come out with <hi>Palmes</hi> in their hands; that is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall become theirs, and they ſhall reign and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>He doth not apply theſe things to us in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as you ſeem to underſtand him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He tells us indeed, <hi>p.</hi> 124. <hi>That he will not apply them to times and places.</hi> But thoſe words are only a groſs equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation (which he muſt be very thick-ſcull'd who doth not diſcern) for he had done it already. Having told his Hearers than <hi>they</hi> were Chriſts Witneſſes, and that now <hi>they</hi> were in a <hi>ſackcloth condition</hi> (as his phraſe is) but that it would not laſt long, and that before it was ended they ſhould have power to reſtrain the higher powers and trouble the people. What need he tell them more? It is enough, I make no queſtion, to make them lift up their heads (as he oft exhorts them) and bear them very high; as being likely in ſhort time to have Dominion over us. And I cannot for my life but look upon them as ſatiating their fancies, with the imagination of this day of vengeance. <hi>Methinks I ſee them</hi> (to uſe the words of a famous Writer againſt our Church and State in another caſe) <hi>like a man, who in the drought obſerves the Skie, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and watching, when any thing will drop that may ſolace them with the likeneſs of a puniſhment from heaven upon us; which they ſtreight explain as they pleaſe.</hi> No evil can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63803:41"/>us, but preſently they poſitively interpret it, a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon us for their ſakes: and as if the very <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of Gods Judgments</hi> had been delivered to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody and Expoſition, they make the people believe that <hi>the Witneſſes are ſmiting the earth with plagues, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their teſtimony againſt us.</hi> But thanks be to God, their Reading declares it abundantly to be a falſe Copy which they uſe. <hi>For</hi> (to ſpeak in his words again) <hi>they often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to their own bad deeds and ſucceſſes the teſtimony of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour; and to the good deeds and ſucceſſes of other men, Divins wrath and vengeance.</hi> And beſides, they have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the people ſo oft with their falſe Predictions from theſe and other Propheſies, that I hope the world will ſee, <hi>theſe are falſe Witneſſes</hi> (if I may uſe the words of <hi>David</hi> to a different ſenſe) <hi>that are riſen up againſt us, breathing forth cruelty:</hi> who behold lying Viſions, and prophecy out of their own hearts: whoſe thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, waſting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction are in their paths. And I would to God you for your part would ſeriouſly conſider (to uſe his words once more) <hi>that to counterfeit the hand of God is the boldeſt of all forgeries; and that he who without any warrant but his own ſurmiſe takes upon him perpetually to unſold the ſecrets and unſearchable Myſteries of high Providence, is likely for the moſt part to miſtake and ſlander them: and approaches to the madneſs of thoſe reprobate thoughts that would wrest the ſword of juſtice out of Gods hand, and imploy it more juſtly in their own conceit, It is but a ſmall thing for ſuch men as theſe to graſp at all power here on earth; when we ſee them doing little leſs than laying hands on the Weapons of God himſelf, which are his judgments; to wield and manage them by the ſway and bent of their own frail cogitations.</hi> It is true indeed, in this manner to ſit ſpelling and obſerving Divine Juſtice upon every accident and ſlight diſturbance that may happen humanely to the affairs of men, is but a fragment
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63803:41"/>of your broken Revenge: yet it <hi>is the ſhrewdeſt and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningeſt Obloquy</hi> (as he well obſerves) <hi>that can be thrown upon our actions.</hi> For if they can perſwade the people, that we are purſued with the divine Vengeance, they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their end to make all men forſake us, and think the worſt that can be thought of us. If they can make them believe that they are the <hi>witneſſes of Chriſt,</hi> and we <hi>the beaſt that aſcends out of the bottomleſs pit:</hi> that we are going to <hi>ſlay them,</hi> and that three or four years hence <hi>they ſhall riſe again,</hi> and all become theirs: they have promoted their Deſign in the craftieſt manner that can be deviſed. The <hi>ſtill people</hi> will be put into ſeditious commotions notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Laws; they that are now quiet will be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as with a mighty wind, and conceit (poor Souls) that they are moved by the <hi>Spirit of the Lord, and are doing the work of God, fulfilling prophecies, and making the cleareſt Comment on the Revelations.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>But if there be not a fatal blindneſs on them, I ſhall plainly ſhew you, that this is ſo groſs a Cheat that no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving perſon can be deluded by it. Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> you muſt know is not the firſt that hath ſuborn'd the <hi>Revelation</hi> to ſpeak on his ſide, and witneſs to his Cauſe. There have been many before him who have aſſumed the perſons of Prophets, and prognoſticated their own wiſhes would come to paſs. But the event hath ſo evidently detected the fraud, and made the forgery appear, that he is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent who goes about to ſerve himſelf of this old trick; and they prodigiouſly ſilly who will ſtill be deluded by it. And feed on the weak conjectures of thoſe who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ſupport their ſinking ſpirits, but that which hath made ſo many aſham'd who relyed on it.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Archer</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">In his Book of the perſonal reign of Chriſt.</note>, you muſt know in the year 1642, from this very prophecy of <hi>the two witneſſes,</hi> filled the peoples heads with this Conceit, <hi>that the end of the Papacy would
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63803:42"/>be in the year</hi> 1666. They are his expreſs words <hi>pag.</hi> 44. And he repeats the ſame again <hi>p.</hi> 46. where he tells us, <hi>that the Witneſſes ſhall recover again in</hi> 1666. <hi>and draw off one Kingdom in Europe from the Papacy and ruin</hi> Rome; <hi>and this was that Wo which ends the ſixth. Trumpet.</hi> Upon which account he adds (<hi>p.</hi> 60.) that the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> may begin preſently after the ruin of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Thouſand years</hi> commence <hi>An.</hi> 1670. This no doubt was of ſingular uſe in thoſe dayes to inſpire your people with lofty hopes, and bear up their hearts in <hi>the good Old Cauſe</hi> againſt all diſcouragements: and therefore Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> flyes to this Sanctuary now, and expects the ſame ſucceſs again on the ſpirits of his Ignorant Proſelytes, who have forgot the vanity of ſuch Prophets, or never reflect on the uncertainty of their Gueſſes.</p>

               <p>It need be no trouble to you, becauſe you may reap a ſingular profit by hearing how ſuch as he have deluded your expectations. For there was another man a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> who in his Lectures at St. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence-Jewry,</hi> about the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> (printed by an Order of a committee of the houſe of Commons,<note place="margin">Mr. Fr. Woodcock.</note> 27. <hi>April</hi> 1643,) tells us quite another ſtory; and will have the riſing of the Witneſſes to begin more early. For his opinion is that the 1260. years begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt invaſion of the <hi>Empire An.</hi> 365. and the ſacking of <hi>Rome An.</hi> 410. And the year he pitches on, is 380, or two or three years before: and then the end of them (excluding the three years and a half in which the Witneſſes ly dead) fell out about 1637. or 1638. Then, he ſaith, the Antichriſtian powers, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Biſhops <hi>ſlew the Witneſſes,</hi> by ſilencing, ſuſpending, and throwing them out of their places. And then there was <hi>great rejoycing and making merry</hi> (according to <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10.) by <hi>the Popiſh
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63803:42"/>Prelatical Faction,</hi> as he is pleaſed to call them. But after <hi>three years and an half, i. e.</hi> at the beginning of the long Parliament, <hi>the ſpirit of life from God entred into them,</hi> and made them ſtand upon their feet, and reſtored them to their liberty, to the great aſtoniſhment of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faction. Nay, <hi>they aſcended up to heaven</hi> (<hi>verſ.</hi> 12) <hi>i. e.</hi> were called by the Parliament to a more ample condition. and <hi>they went up in a cloud, i. e.</hi> abundance of people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated their freedom. Which was then done moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably when three of theſe Witneſſes (Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi>) were brought in triumph from the utmoſt parts of the Kingdom. Then <hi>was the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi> (ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.13.) <hi>i. e.</hi> great Commotions which began with the Parliament. And <hi>a tenth part of the City fell, i. e.</hi> if you will believe him, Prelacy and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: <hi>and</hi> 7000. <hi>men were ſlain, i. e.</hi> Prelates, Deans, and Chapters with their appurtenances, had their honour, places, maintenance taken from them. In ſhort, he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirms the Scene wherein theſe great things muſt be acted, is <hi>one kingdom</hi> only: And that it is no other but the <hi>Iſland of great Britain:</hi> and the time of doing them, ſome years before and ſince the calling of the <hi>Long Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi> p. 83. And ſo he concludes very triumphantly, <hi>p.</hi> 90. <hi>Since the Witneſſes are ſlain and riſen again; chear up then: ſtrengthen theſe weak hands. Verily, the bitterneſs of death is already over; and from henceforth expect better dayes, than either our eyes, or the eyes of our Forefathers ever ſaw.</hi> Which is a clear Demonſtration, that theſe men think <hi>themſelves</hi> concern'd in all the good things, and <hi>us</hi> in all the Evil, contained in that Book: and that every little change in our affairs, makes them imagine they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about to be raiſed, and us to fall under their feet: but yet that their high Confidences hitherto have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded, and were the <hi>birth</hi> of their proud Fancies, not the <hi>fruit</hi> of their ſound Underſtanding of the Revelations
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63803:43"/>of God. And ſuch M. <hi>B</hi>'s prophecies I hope will prove, who notwithſtanding all thoſe glorious dayes which his Fellows promiſed, is ſtill whining and complaining of their <hi>Sackcloth condition;</hi> and waits <hi>for another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to make them <hi>aſcend up to heaven</hi> in a cloud, and <hi>ſlay</hi> 7000. <hi>men,</hi> once more, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the <hi>Biſhops, Deans,</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi> with all the maintenance that belongs to them. Yet this I will ſay for him, that he is a little more merciful than Mr. <hi>Woodcock</hi> was. For he only threatens deſtruction to us in this world: but the other ſaith, <hi>the power of the Witneſſes to ſhut Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that it rain not,</hi> is the power <hi>to hold all tidings of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, mercy and peace, from the Antichriſtian Gentiles</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as We) <hi>while they continue ſuch:</hi> and declaring them a people to whom no Heaven, no Forgiveneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs while in that condition, <hi>i. e.</hi> while we oppoſe your deſires. You may read this <hi>p.</hi> 70. &amp; <hi>p.</hi> 73.</p>

               <p>Nay, let me tell you a little more, for fear you ſhould forget all this, and ſhut your eyes again. About two year after this Prophet, another, who will not name himſelf, aroſe; and dedicated a Book to the parliament with this Title; <hi>The great Myſtery of God;</hi> or <hi>the Viſion of the Evening and the Morning Opened.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Printed 1645.</note> In which he tells us the <hi>two Houſes</hi> of the Lords and Commons, are <hi>the two Witneſſes</hi> which the Spirit of Chriſt foretold ſhould <hi>be raiſed up to Heaven,</hi> the high place of Juſtice and Judicature. For though all the people of God were Witneſſes for 1260 years, yet they in a more eſpecial manner: becauſe <hi>they were not only to proteſt againſt Antichriſt, but were that judgment which ſhould ſit, and take his Kingdom and Dominion from him, raiſed to Heaven by the power of Chriſt for that end.</hi> 7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 26.<note n="*" place="margin">For the Ruin of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Babilon (he tells you in his Title page) and erecting the Spiritual Jeruſalem were the ground of our Commotions, which were not to ceaſe till by that Parliament the work was ſo compleated, that Chriſt in and by his Sts. ſhould raign on earth a 1000. years.</note>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:63803:43"/>And therefore he is very confident that our Lord reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 1260. years, from the year 375. So that the time of the Witneſſes propheſying in Sackcloth ended 1635. Then they <hi>were ſlain, i. e.</hi> deprived of their civil power, if they ſpoke any thing againſt the Pope and Prelates; and thoſe three Gentlemen mention'd before, he tells us, were a lively Emblem of the reſt. But then between 1638. and 1639. the Spirit of God entred into the hearts and Spirits of the Godly party, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as he did into <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and they took all the power and ſtrength they had, to free themſelves from that dead and ſlaviſh condition, whereinto <hi>Antichriſt</hi> had brought them. And a great fear fell upon all the Antichriſtian party both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> yea (ſuch, if you will believe him, was the terror of their appearance) at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. And then preſently <hi>they heard a voice from Heaven,</hi> (<hi>i e.</hi> the place of Judicature) <hi>ſaying, come up hither, i.e.</hi> that Wiſe &amp; Godly men would aſcend now to thoſe places to do juſtice upon Antichriſt. This Voice was heard firſt from the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in <hi>Scotland, in whom</hi> (mind it well for it's rare Doctrine) <hi>all the power that is in Heaven did origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſide:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> and afterwards in <hi>England,</hi> both from the whole Common-wealth, &amp; likewiſe from the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who ſate in Heaven. And <hi>they aſcended to Heaven,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> to the high places of Judicature,) the ſame time 1639. in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and afterward here in <hi>this Kingdom. For the reſt of the godly were with Child with this great Truth, that the Lord Jeſus in and by his Saints was to rule all nations with a rod of Iron:</hi> Which is ſpoken of he ſaith, 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. &amp;c. And they cryed and travail'd in pain to God, by humble and ſervent Prayers; and to his Witneſſes which ſate in Heaven by humble petitions, from the year of Chriſt 1639. to 1641. <hi>That the Lord Chriſt, that man-child,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v.p. 5. &amp; p. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>might in and by his Saints rule the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a Rod of Iron.</hi> Whereupon the great <hi>Red Dragon,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63803:44"/>i. e.</hi> the Popiſh Lords and Prelates beſtirred themſelves to devour this man-child as ſoon as it was born: but the people of God beſtirr'd themſelves both to God by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to the godly party in Parliament, that theſe Popiſh Lords and Prelates might be caſt out. And theſe Petitions and prayers were heard of Chriſt and his Witneſſes, 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. And ſo the Church did not only <hi>bring forth the Man-child of Government</hi> (mark that; for it tells you ſome <hi>Presbyterians</hi> taught, that all power was originally in the People) <hi>but it was likewiſe received up to God and his Throne, into the high place of Judicature.</hi> But the Dragon with his tail drew a third part of the Parliament to fall off at the ſame time, and likewiſe a war was raiſed between the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his <hi>Angels</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the King and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) and the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> and his Witneſſes ſitting in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> In ſhort, he tells you, that what was done here ſhould be done in all other Kingdoms, in the year 1655. When Chriſt and his Witneſſes ſhould take the power of all the Ten Kingdoms, which Antichriſt had, into their hands; and ſhould raign. Yet ſo that there ſhould be ſome little reliques of Antichriſt in the hearts of men till the year 1700. Then the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> he aſſures you ſhall be built and the Lamb be married to his Church and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt caſt not only out of the World, but out of the hearts of men.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the goodly <hi>Dreams</hi> or <hi>Viſions</hi> (call them which you pleaſe) of your Divines heretofore. And no doubt they were then as much believed as Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions are now. Who if he live to ſee himſelf deceived, will be able it's like to invent ſome new beginning for the 1260. years; and you will ſtill be ſo fooliſh as to give him credit; unleſs theſe things convince you of the madneſs of the Prophet. But if he be at a loſs, and think ſuch a blind creature as I can give him notice of any thing he ſees not already, I may help him at a dead lift, and direct
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63803:44"/>him to a Book where he ſhall find relief. All my fear is, that he will give me little thanks for my pains, becauſe it will make his heart ſick, to hear his hope is like to be ſo long deferr'd. For after theſe Writers I have mention'd, Mr. <hi>Tho. Parker</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> printed a Book about theſe things,<note place="margin">The Viſions and Prophec. of Dan. opened 1646.</note> in which he layes down <hi>two wayes of accommodating the years.</hi> If they begin when there were but <hi>dark and weak beginnings of the ſigns</hi> mentioned, that was he thinks in the year 390. and ſo the 1260. years end with 1649. <hi>Then the Turks will ceaſe to be looſed, and the next year after, they may begin to fall together with the Pope,</hi> if this way of accommodation hold. If it do not; then we muſt ſtay a great while. For the more <hi>evident, open and perfect ſtate of the things foregoing</hi> was not till the year 600. and ſo no ſhutting of the Heavens, no turning the water into bloud, at leaſt no putting off their ſackcloth, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> now expects; till the year 1859.</p>

               <p>The laſt man ſpeaks modeſtly, and therefore it was not amiſs to hear him. As for the reſt I ſhould not have troubled you with their conjectures, had it not been to let you ſee; <hi>Firſt,</hi> what they think of us, whom they call the <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> the <hi>Popiſh party,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Nations;</hi> the <hi>followers of the Dragon,</hi> and ſuch like Names. <hi>Secondly,</hi> what they think themſelves; who are, in their own eſteem, the <hi>Witneſſes of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Godly party,</hi> the <hi>Saints that are to rule the Nations,</hi> with a rod of Iron; the <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Lamb,</hi> who are to <hi>aſcend to Heaven,</hi> the Seat of Juſtice, and do execution upon us. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> What a Sandy Foundation their hopes are built upon; and how confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they are, and well perſwaded of themſelves without any cauſe at all. And that indeed is the chiefeſt thing I aimed at. To make you ſenſible, they have no ground for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63803:45"/>that high opinion they have conceiv'd of their own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and inſight into the things of God: they being blindly lead by their own Imaginations and paſſionate Deſires, while they think they underſtand and ſee more than all the Wiſe men in the World. So the laſt man but one, that I named, brag'd and vapoured: <hi>glorying that he had found out that truth which none of the wicked ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; neither Prieſt nor Prophet; Rulers nor Seers.</hi> All is hid and covered from them, and the reaſon is, becauſe they drank of the Cup of the Whore, of which if a man take but one Sip, he is utterly incapable to have the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or myſteries made known to him. And therefore he triumphs in this manner over all our Nobles and Clergy: <hi>Who will beleive of all our great men and learned Prelates, that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Clouds of Heaven, and is ſet down upon the Throne of Judicature in his Saints and Witneſſes, to judg that man of ſin?</hi> No indeed; they had more wit. And yet this the man thought, in his ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Wiſdom, <hi>to be as clear as the Sun.</hi>

               <p>It's eaſy to ſee that is nothing elſe but their pride and vain conceit of themſelves; as if God would reveal all his ſecrets to them, and hide them from others. For they are the <hi>Watch-men</hi> upon the Tower, the <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches, the Lords <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies:</hi> And they that follow them, are the <hi>Holy ones,</hi> the <hi>Dear people of God,</hi> the <hi>little Flock,</hi> the <hi>Lambs of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Meek of the Earth,</hi> the <hi>Redeemed ones,</hi> and the <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63803:45"/>of Jacob.</hi> Nay, as ſoon as ever any perſon comes to hear them preach; they hope there is a <hi>work of Grace</hi> in their hearts, and that they begin <hi>to ſavour the things of God;</hi> and to <hi>deſire the ſincere Milk</hi> of the Word. As for our Miniſters, Alas poor Creatures! they are the <hi>Falſe Prophets, blind Guides, Idol Shepherds,</hi> that have eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but cannot ſee at all.

Hence it is that the meaneſt of you takes himſelf to be wiſer than the beſt of us; than any of our Biſhops and Prieſts, nay the whole Clergy put together. And if we will not have ſuch a man in the ſame eſteem that he hath himſelf; preſently we are lookt upon as enemies of the power of Godlineſs, formal fellows, or meer moraliſts, that hate the true ſeed.</p>

And that you are ſo adventurous and bold in expounding the Holy Scriptures, as if it were given you in that moment, as it was the Apoſtles, what you ſhould think and what you ſhould ſpeak. Nay, ſo deep have you drunk of this Witches Cup, and are ſo intoxicated with ſelf-conceit and ſelf-love, that you imagine all your Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and forms of Religion and Government muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all the world. For your mind is the mind of God, and your words the Oracles of God.

               <p>You would have me think then, that you ſpeak their ſenſe not your own: But I perceive you are a little taken with thoſe new Phraſes, of the <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing time,</hi> and <hi>witneſſing work.</hi> As indeed it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the humor of your party, if a noted man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented an unuſual Phraſe, preſently to form their mouths to that new mode of ſpeaking: Juſt like a pack of Hounds, that when one begins to open, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately all ſollow, and almoſt deafen one with the noiſe. When a Preacher, for inſtance, from that text, <hi>David ſerved his Generation by the will of God,</hi> raiſed this impertinent Obſervation; <hi>That it is our duty to mind Generation-work;</hi> inſtantly all Pulpits ſounded with this Doctrine of <hi>Generation-work.</hi> That was the phraſe in thoſe days: In ſo much that you ſhould hear both Miniſter and people bewailing it in their prayers, that they had not minded <hi>Generation-work</hi> more. Which made ſome good innocent ſouls, that were not acquainted with the ſecret, bluſh when they firſt heard it, and wonder what they meant. And to ſay the truth, that was a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to tell. For the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> I think, meant nothing but <hi>reforming according to the Covenant,</hi> the Lord having given them ſuch an Opportunity, as the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> ſpeak in their Anſwer<note n="*" place="margin">Preſented 25.

And withall,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63803:50"/>they add, This Kirk when the Lord gave them the calling, <hi>conſidered not their own deadneſs, nor ſtaggered at the promiſe through unbelief, but gave glory to God.</hi> And who knows but the Lord hath now ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with <hi>England,</hi> which will not be removed, till firſt, and before all, the Worſhip of his name and the Government of his houſe be ſetled according to his will? This was their <hi>Generation-work.</hi> But others meant by this Phraſe; the pulling down every thing that they imagin'd Antichriſtian; Presbytery and all. And ſome went ſo far as to think it was <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-work</hi> to pull down Monarchy, <hi>to bind Kings in chains, nay Protectors in fetters of Iron.</hi> And when they were not able to do the laſt, though they had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the other; then they fell to <hi>witneſſing-work,</hi> and <hi>propheſying</hi> againſt it: For that was the Common-wealths mens phraſe, when they ſpoke of O.

                  <hi>The Lords faithful people, the fooliſh contemptible nothings, irreconcileable enemies to the Government of a ſingle perſon, were putting up their prayers and appeals to the Lord, witneſſing, and prophecying againſt him, and the Beaſt-like foundation on which he ſtood,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63803:51"/>he tells them that it is a Nation ingag'd to God in a higher, more extraordinary way than any Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the Earth; a Reformed Nation: A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have riſen up againſt <hi>Antichriſt</hi> more than ever any people have done; <hi>and that is the great work of God in theſe times:</hi> And therefore certainly <hi>God hath a love to them,</hi> becauſe they break the Ice, and begin the work, and ariſe in ſuch a way as they do, for the pulling down of the man of ſin.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63803:54"/>take wonderfully; and make a Rabble run like mad to hear what new thing, this <hi>Witneſs-bearing</hi> is. For ſuch is the fillineſs of this people, that they imagine with every <hi>new phraſe,</hi> there is ſome <hi>new thing</hi> to be learnt; and that the <hi>old Preachers</hi> are nothing to the <hi>new Teachers;</hi> and they who <hi>hold forth</hi> have ſomething more to ſay, than he that only <hi>Speaks.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what will they fancy there to be in <hi>Propheſying;</hi> and <hi>Witneſs-bearing?</hi> nothing leſs, I warrant you, than a clear Diſcovery of the things that lay hid from Ages and Generations; the opening of Seals; the numbring of the years, and unlocking all the Secrets of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. And though they underſtand never a word, yet they will believe themſelves marvelouſly inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when they are well ſtuft with phraſes: and are able to talk of <hi>Generation-work Witneſſing times, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Heaven and commanding that it rain not, turning the waters into blood, and ſuch like things:</hi> eſpecially when they can fancy themſelves <hi>to be Witneſſes, and to have Power given them to propheſie, and to ſend fire out of their mouths to devour the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</hi>

And if ever they chance to reflect on the miſcariage of their former hopes wherewith they were big, they will then have a trick ready at hand to ſalve the buſineſs; that it ſhall not diſcourage their preſent confidence. It was only becauſe they were not hot enough, and did not open their mouths wide enough, and breathe forth fiery and devouring prayers againſt the Enemy. And therefore now they will call to one another as Mr.

                  <hi>O you that have any credit in Heaven, pray now. What? Doth fire come out of the mouth of the Witneſſing-people of God to devour their Enemies, and will you ſhut your mouth and not pray?

When you are about it, then <hi>Out-wayes</hi> are dangerous. All muſt be done by the <hi>Rule</hi> and by <hi>Line</hi> (or in a new phraſe by <hi>Rope</hi>) according to the Word. In brief; I recollect now that this is the <hi>Out-waying time,</hi> in order to thoſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times of <hi>Walking upon the Rope.</hi> But I pray, What was it that I diverted you from?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, now I ſee you are come to your ſelf. And will you then ever hear me ſpeak a Sentence or two more— I thank you for this ſmall ſilence. You have ſnapt, of late, at my words too haſtily; and cut me ſhort in what I was going to ſay; which was plainly this. We obſerve the Multitude that run in your way to be a company of blind Ignorant Creatures, that have ſcarce a drachm of the ſaving knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Myſteries of our Religion. Nor do they care to know theſe things; but only content themſelves to come to <hi>Church</hi> and ſay their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and learn their <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and hear perhaps a Sermon, which they preſently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get. Whereas our People are very inquiſitive after knowledg, and can diſcourſe rarely of matters of Religion, and repeat Sermons; and beſides, are very careful to know the pure Goſpel-way of Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God. And, truly, when I conſider things well, I cannot but wonder how ſottiſh many of your
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63803:59"/>Conformable creatures are, who never ſcruple any thing, and would without all doubt conform to the groſſeſt Superſtition and Popery; ſhould it be injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But we are very tender, and ſolicitous as you your ſelves confeſs to have pure Ordinances, and to know the very mind and way of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive you have little or nothing more to ſay of this matter; therefore I pray let me tell you what I think. I cannot deny that many of our common People are very Ignorant: Nay, they themſelves are ſenſible of it and will confeſs it. But I muſt add; that yours are generally Ignorant too, only think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very knowing. Now which of theſe think you are the worſe; they that are Ignorant but <hi>humble</hi> and void of ſelf-conceit; or they that are as Ignorant, but very <hi>Proud</hi> and conceited of their Knowledg? Nay, bold &amp; confident of their own skill, taking upon them to inſtruct their betters, to diſpute with our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and that as if they were their Equals if not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours; without any reſpect to their learning or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? For I muſt tell you withall, that as to their duty towards God and man; a great number of thoſe, on whom you beſtow only your pitty, and eſteem Ignorant creatures; have more underſtanding, at leaſt more conſcience than many of thoſe that ſigh over them.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>They are more reverent in their Devotions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God; more reſpectful in their behaviour to his Miniſters; more obedient to their Governours; more humble and modeſt before all their betters; and, as far as I can ſee, more juſt and charitable toward all men: And therefore are in a better diſpoſition to learn more and increaſe in knowledg, than your prating ſelf-conceited people. And if there be ſuch Effects as theſe of the little knowledg that you deſpiſe; and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63803:59"/>ſew better fruits than talkativeneſs, malepert contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of their Elders, cenſuring and contemning the ignorance of others, from that great high know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which you boaſt of, I would fain know which of theſe you judg are like to be moſt ſaving. But of theſe things perhaps we may have occaſion to diſcourſe ſome other time. As for the Reſt; I flatly deny that your people are more knowing. For of thoſe that are the moſt earneſt for <hi>pure Ordinances, Goſpel-worſhip,</hi> and cry out upon our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> nay abhor it, as <hi>Superſtitions, Popiſh, Idolatrous,</hi> &amp;c. there is not one in an hundred that knows what thoſe words mean. Be but ſo true to your ſelf and ſtudious to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand men aright, as to ask the next you meet, and bid them deal plainly and freely with you, what <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Superſtition</hi> or <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> is; and I doubt not you will find they are like a company of Piggs running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an old Sow (which falls a grunting) ſqueak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making a fearful cry they know not for what.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>No. I only compare their cryes together, which are both alike unreaſonable. Do but ask for inſtance what they mean by <hi>Popery:</hi> and ſome of theſe Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Zealots will tell you, it is to do <hi>that which is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church of Rome:</hi> Which is no better than the voice of a Brute. If this be Popery, all our Religion is Popery. We muſt turn Jews, or Turks, or Pagans, that we may not be Papiſts. And yet that will not do neither; for this Popery will ſtill be found among
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63803:60"/>us, that we pray and give thanks to God, which are actions common to all the world with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>True. But this ſottiſh Definition of Popery you will be ſure to meet withal from ſome, if you will but take the pains to enquire. Others it's like will tell you, that it is Popery <hi>to do any thing after that manner that the Papiſts do:</hi> And then we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kneel, nor lift up our eyes or our hands, nor meet together in a Church —</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I ſigh to think of the intolerable blockiſhneſs of thoſe people that will pretend to know all the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God. For others, who think themſelves more wiſe than the reſt, will tell you that <hi>to uſe any ceremonies in uſe among them,</hi> is certainly Popiſh. And then we muſt uſe none at all (and ſo make no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſion of Religious devotion, which muſt be done in ſome manner or other) or elſe they muſt be ſuch as are confeſſedly abſurd and ridiculons. Nay all civil Ceremonies and Cuſtomes will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden us in time by theſe men. At leaſt for every thing that they hate, this ſhall be the name, <hi>Popiſh, Antichriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Babyloniſh.</hi> For O. C. himſelf,<note place="margin">True Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue p. 15.</note> I well remember, could not be carried to his grave without their cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; that it was <hi>a needleſs, chargeable, Popiſh funeral ſolemnity;</hi> becauſe there was <hi>black Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> a <hi>Bed of State,</hi> and a <hi>Waxen Image</hi> Nay, let <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nareby</hi> look to it ſelf, for that is <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> too in ſuch mens opinion, and this Kingdom one of the Ten Horns of the Beaſt. And down ſhall my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> go alſo (when they are able) as an

                  <hi>Image of that Government; together with all the pomp and foolery</hi> which attends him; as their words former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C</speaker>
               <p>It's well if there be not. But you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find ſome who will tell you, <hi>that all Ceremonies invented by the Pope are Popiſh;</hi> and think themſelves, much wiſer than their Neighbors if upon this ground they furiouſly rage againſt our Church. But the beſt of it is, that this is nothing to the purpoſe: For none of ours were invented by him. The Croſs was uſed among Chriſtian people long before the name or power of the Pope was heard of: And ſo was kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and white garments, and bowing the body in adoration of our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>But I have heard ſome ſay, that it is <hi>Popiſh to do any thing of this nature but what is preſcribed by the Word.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This is as ſottiſh as all the reſt. For it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, both that nothing may be done in or about the worſhip of God, but what we have a Command for, in Holy Scripture; and that the Pope and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are the only perſons who have done any thing not preſcribed there. Elſe why ſhould they call it <hi>Popiſh,</hi> or <hi>Romiſh,</hi> more than <hi>Patriarkiſh,</hi> or <hi>Greek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>No. All the ancient Chriſtians did many things in Divine worſhip appointed by the Scriptures, for which they had no particular preſcription there. Nay, ſuch is your Ignorance, you your ſelves do ſo too and never mind it. For what direction is there to make a new prayer twice or thrice a day? And one Prayer before the Sermon, and another after? To
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63803:61"/>receive the Sacrament of Chriſt's body and blood in the morning and not after Supper? To deliver it into the hands of every perſon that receives it, with Prayer for him, or Exhortation to him, or both? —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Pray ſtay. You will let nothing at all be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, if you be let alone: At leaſt nothing of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. We are taught by our Divines, that, to ordain ſuch a multitude of Ceremonies, as will imploy moſt of our thoughts and care in time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice how to do them aright; deſerves that name. Or if we make any of them an eſſential part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or give them power to obtain pardon for us, or work grace in us: Or, laſtly, it we make them Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical and neceſſary Commands that bind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as the Laws of God do: Then call them <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> or what you pleaſe.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>You ſay well: And I confeſs I know a little more than I did.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>O that you would help to reduce thoſe ſilly, and many of them I hope well-meaning ſouls, who through mere Ignorance and blind prejudice are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the grave and ſober way of ſerving God among us, to follow their own vain fancies; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps conceit they are <hi>Witneſſing</hi> againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and the <hi>wayes of Antichriſt;</hi> that is, againſt they know not what.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Nor Superſtition neither. Though with the ſame doltiſh Ignorance, they charge us with that vice which they are moſt guilty of themſelves and do not know it: As appears by what I told you at our laſt meeting.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That's becauſe they like nothing that we ſay: And becauſe it makes them ſo plainly guilty of that which they condemn. But do they like Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s definition of it better?</p>

               <p>You may have met it's poſſible with his <hi>Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> for they have been long in the Engliſh Tongue. There he tells you almoſt in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Book,<note place="margin">Book 1. chap. 12. pag. 41.</note> that as <hi>Religion</hi> hath its name from <hi>binding,</hi> and is ſet as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to wandring Liberty; becauſe it binds men up, and preſcribes bounds and limits to them, in which true Piety conſiſts: So <hi>Superſtition</hi> hath its name from <hi>going beyond all meaſures;</hi> being a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that will not be bounded nor limited; or as his very words are, <hi>that not being contented with the manner and order preſcribed, heapeth up together a ſuperfluous and order preſcribed, heapeth up together a ſuperfluous number of vain things.</hi> Do you like this, I ſay, or no? If you do, then I will ſhew you that as in Prayers, ſo in other holy Duties, your humour is to keep no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure nor order, but to heap up one ſuperfluous thing upon another: No ſet Form can content it, no limits or bounds can hold it; but it is ſtill inventing ſomething new to pleaſe your ſelves and others; and then you fancy God is pleaſed, becauſe you are. I know you have a conceit that you keep your ſelves within the limits of the Word, and that you dare not for a world ſtir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the confines which God preſcribes: But this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes your Ignorance appear the more groſs, as I will plainly ſhew you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>I gueſs by what you ſaid the laſt time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts you will be; but it will turn us too much out of our way to enter into that diſcourſe at this time.</p>

               <p>Well then, Il'e let it alone till you give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion. And the rather, becauſe I would have you go as ſoon as may be, and ask what <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> is? That's another word in theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> mouths, of as much efficacy and as little ſenſe as all the reſt, for when they are angry, they charge one another with it as well as us. The Independents were wont to ſay, that it was <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> to ſet up the office of Ruling Elders in the Church: And I can ſhew you one that calls the <hi>Church-Covenant, requiring men to give ſome ſigns of grace,</hi> and all the way of <hi>Admiſſion of Members</hi> into Independent Congregations, by the very ſame Name. And therefore I believe you will ſoon leave ſuch to wrangle it out; and go and ask ſome others, what they mean to bawl ſo againſt <hi>Forms.</hi> But I believe there is not one of a thouſand can give a reaſon, why he may not as well accuſe the whole frame of Nature as our Liturgy upon this account. Eſpecially if you tell him that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Heaven or Earth but hath a Form. That when we underſtand, it is by forming ſome concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our Mind; and that we form our Speech or words to make our conceptions underſtood by others. And therefore even your Prayers muſt be in a Form, or elſe they are ſenſleſs ſtuff; a meer noiſe and ſound that no body can underſtand.</p>

               <p>And ſo many of your Prayers have none at all; but are then thought moſt <hi>heavenly,</hi> when they are moſt <hi>confuſed;</hi> and to have much of <hi>God</hi> in them when they have nothing of <hi>Man.</hi> For the common word is, I like not <hi>Forms,</hi> &amp;c. He ſtill ſticks in <hi>Forms:</hi> He is a dull <hi>formal</hi> man: Which are Phraſes as ſet and ſtinted as our Prayers. They are never out of uſe, but repeated an hundred times a day. No

               <p>I muſt ſay more than that. They hate a Form of Prayer, but love to pray in theſe reviling forms of ſpeech. For they tell God, how a <hi>Superſtitious</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> way of worſhip hath juſtled out his own Inſtitutions. That men worſhip the <hi>Graven Images</hi> of their own inventions. That <hi>Gebal, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amalek</hi> are riſen up againſt them. And the people are taught to go and <hi>ſpread their anger and threatnings before</hi> the Lord: And to tell him, that it is an <hi>angry time, a perſecuting time, a day of great wrath; abundance of anger and wrath,</hi>

               <p>Do you know what he means when he gives this for another reaſon of the hatred of the world to the Saints; that <hi>they deſtroy their Gods, deſtroy their Idols.

               <p>The reaſon was becauſe he put them very much out of the rode of their Phraſes. This made them fear Chriſt would be taken away from them; and free Grace be deſpiſed, and a Covenant of works reſtored. And for the very ſame cauſe they raiſe ſuch a duſt now againſt many of our Miniſters. They do not hear them talk of getting <hi>into Chriſt, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an intereſt in Chriſt;</hi> and that for this end they muſt <hi>get Faith,</hi> and <hi>go to the promiſe,</hi> and <hi>eye Chriſt in the promiſe,</hi> and <hi>cloſe with him in the promiſe, and lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves flat upon the promiſe; and go out of themſelves that the promiſe may enter:</hi> All which you think are very myſterious things, becauſe you are Ignorant; for let all the ſenſe that is contain'd in any of theſe forms, be delivered in proper plain and eaſie words, and you deſpiſe it as a thing of naught. Though you talk of <hi>Goſpel-light,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel-diſcoveries,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel-mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations,</hi> yet there is little or nothing all this while
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63803:64"/>to be known or underſtood. Religion you will have to be ſuch a Myſtery, that if a man thinks he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it, he ought to conclude he is not acquainted with it. It is a certain ſign a man hath no skill in it, if he imagine he knows the plain meaning of it. It muſt be look't upon as a <hi>Great ſomething:</hi> A thing to be ſtar'd at and admired, but no body knows what: At leaſt you cannot clearly diſcover it to us, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the brags we hear of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is (which is a great argument of their Ignorance) that great numbers of your Religious people, have been ſo eaſily perverted and turn'd to the wildeſt Sects; when as the cleareſt Reaſon that our men can ſpeak will not convince them. What multitudes have ſoon turn'd <hi>Anabaptiſts, Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Familiſts,</hi> and <hi>Behemiſts;</hi> but how few, and with what difficulty, can be brought to the Church of <hi>England?</hi> This is an evident proof to all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering men that they can be made in love with any thing but only Reaſon: And that a Diſciple of <hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudding</hi> ſhall lead greater troops after him, than the <hi>graveſt Divine.</hi> They will ſooner liſten to a fancy, and are more ready to embrace another pack of new Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; than the ſobereſt ſenſe and the wiſeſt Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that can be ſpoken.</p>
               <p>There is a famous and undeniable inſtance of it in the <hi>other,</hi> and as you think, the <hi>Purer England.</hi> Was it not a wonder <hi>that the whole Church of</hi> Boſtou (ſome few excepted) <hi>ſhould become Converts on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to a daring woman,</hi> and be infected with her damnable Opinions?

Nor could they ever be diſ-inchanted by all the Arguments and perſwaſions of all the Miniſters in that Country, but <hi>ſhe kept her ſtrength and reputation, even among the people of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. pag. ult.</note> 
                  <hi>till the hand of Civil juſtice laid hold of her; and then ſhe began evidently to deeline, and the faithful to be freed from her forgeries.</hi> So wholeſome ſometime is a little ſeverity: And ſo much is the force of Civil Authority with theſe people, above the ſharpeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Divines. For they oppoſed the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and their <hi>manifeſtations</hi> and <hi>illuminations,</hi> to all their Miniſter's Reaſons; which would do no ſervice at the bar of the Court of Juſtice, where they underſtood none of this language. And now I ſpeak of the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of the Spirit, it is very ſtrange to me, that you ſhould generally expect the Holy Ghoſt ſhould do for you, what Chriſt promiſed at his parting to the Twelve Apoſtles; <hi>teach you all things, and guide you into all truth.</hi> It is another ſign of great Ignorance in you, and of inſincerity I doubt, in many of your Miniſters; who are afraid to diſpoſſeſs you of this conceit, and to inſtruct you in the plain difference between theſe times and thoſe; but ſuffer, if not teach, you to apply to your ſelves whatſoever our Saviour ſpoke to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles alone. A thing which is ſo palpable, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder men ſhould ſo pervert the Scripture;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63803:66"/>eſpecially when they ſee there is no ſuch thing, but that thoſe whom they account the people of God, are of ſeveral, nay contrary minds. And that all cannot be in the right, and yet none they think de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of the Spirit, <hi>to teach them all things and lead them into all truth.</hi> This ſure makes ſo many think every ſtrong and unuſual motion they find within them, is the work and operation of the Spirit of God. And that every place of Scripture that comes on a ſudden into their mind, is darted from Heaven and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate dictate of the Holy Ghoſt: Though never ſo impertinently applied to their preſent occaſions. And that all the ardent affections and tranſports, and raptures they have in prayer or at other ſeaſons, are likewiſe Inſpirations from above; and that now they are filled with the Holy Ghoſt. Which is a groſs and ignorant Concluſion, in my opinion; for want of ſuch obvious conſiderations as theſe; that ſuch heats and flights are common to them with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Poets,</hi> and excellent <hi>Orators;</hi> and that bad men have had them as well as the beſt: As I am able to ſhew you, if you pleaſe.</p>

               <p>Let me tell you notwithſtanding, that this, I believe, is one reaſon that your people are filled with ſo many doubts, jealouſies, and fears of being deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When they have not theſe heats; then they think the Spirit is gone; and how to comfort them, it's hard to tell, till they return again. And now I mention this, give me leave to tell you, it is another evidence of great Ignorance, That the minds of well meaning and honeſt-hearted people among you are full of ſo many ſcruples, and ſo uncertain what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on all occaſions. You may ſay perhaps it is,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63803:66"/>becauſe their conſciences are tender, and very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wary what they do: And ſo you may ſay when you ſee a Blind man tremble and walk ſoftly, and feel his way at every ſtep with his ſtaff, that he is, a very Wary man; when it is not Caution but his want of ſight that makes him ſo diffident. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how is it poſſible they ſhould have any true aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in any caſe, when it is to hard if not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to be reſolved in the great queſtion of all, <hi>What a man muſt do to be ſaved; and attain the ſatisfaction of knowing that be hath an intereſt in Chriſt?</hi> To this, the moſt admired Divines reply, <hi>that a man can have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort but only by going to the promiſe.</hi> O, but ſaith the poor Soul (according as it is taught) <hi>I dare not ſo much as look to the promiſe,</hi>

                  <hi>I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</hi> To this the Anſwer is (p. 115.)

Will a Promiſe do him any good unleſs he believe it to be the very Word of God, on which he ſhould truſt? This is an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable difficulty, as far as I can find.

It muſt firſt go to the promiſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63803:67"/>to fetch faith; and yet how ſhould it go, if it have no faith? In this caſe how ſhould a man chuſe but be full of ſcruples, and like one that is bewildred and loſt, not knowing what will become of him?</p>

               <p>I thank you for remembring me of it. He moves indeed that queſtion <hi>p.</hi> 144. But me-thinks he only leads a man into a worſe Labyrinth.

I would know how to get to the promiſe; &amp; I am told I muſt lie ſtill, that the promiſe may come to me.

What Direction can he give me to bring me out of theſe Bryers? Why? To anſwer this doubt, the only way is to unſay this in the <hi>third Rule,</hi> which ſuppoſes the Promiſe will come of it ſelf, and that I need not bring it home: For it runs in theſe words; <hi>When the promiſe is thus come home to thee, and thou ſeeſt the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and the Authority of it; then all thou haſt to do is this In the ſtream of that promiſe, be carried home to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> p. 149.</p>

               <p>Nor I neither. But the thing he ſeems to aims is this; that a man muſt only wait till Chriſt aſſures
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63803:67"/>him that he had made all the promiſes to him. For thus he explains the buſineſs. <hi>Jacob</hi> would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive till he ſaw the Chariots that were come for him.

                  <hi>Therefore be muſt look to the Chariots of Iſrael firſt</hi> (it ſhould be of <hi>Joſeph</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reſemblance) <hi>and that will convey him to the promiſe: and when the chariots are come, get up into them: The Lord Jeſus is gone to heaven and hath ſent theſe chariots for thee; therefore get thee up, and ſay, Lord, take me up with thee.</hi> And ſo they did: They got up into I know not what fiery Chariots, and mounted into the Air, and there fancied they ſaw the Lord Jeſus immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing himſelf to them; and ſo carrying them to the promiſe, the abſolute promiſe. And I verily believe theſe Doctrines were they from whence the <hi>American Jezabel</hi> (as they call'd her) extracted her Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and by which the people were prepared, to drink of <hi>the cup of her Fornication;</hi> perſwading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that <hi>a man is united to Chriſt and juſtified without Faith,</hi> that <hi>Faith is not a receiving him, but diſcerning be hath received him already;</hi> that <hi>a man is united to Chriſt only by the work of the Spirit upon him, without any act of his;</hi> that <hi>there is a teſtimony of the Spirit and a voice unto the Soul, meerly immediate, without any reſpect unto, or concurrence with the word.</hi> And <hi>that there are diſtinct ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the workings of the ſeveral Perſons; ſo that a Soul may be ſaid to be ſo long under the work of the Father and not the Sons; and ſo long under the work of the Son, and not under the Spirit. And in concluſion, that a man is not effectually converted till he hath full aſſurance,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63803:68"/>and that this is given immediately; all the activity of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being only to act to ſin.</hi> All theſe, I ſay, are the plain ſenſe (if there be any at all in this Book) of what he delivered in more obſcure words.</p>

               <p>Judg then in what uncertainty the Diſciples of theſe Divines live, who never tell them plainly <hi>what Faith is.</hi> And what a ſtrange blindneſs they labour with, who cannot ſee (as they ſpeak) that they are Chriſt's; though they perſwade themſelves that he is theirs. Nor do I ſee what ſatisfaction they are like to receive in particular caſes, any more than in this, the greateſt of all. Your Doctrine ſeems to me to be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, that it's hard to come to any ſolid ſetlement or peace of mind. One of your Rules, for inſtance, is that we muſt have a warrant from the word of God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing we do: If there be neither Precept nor Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe that we can find there to juſtifie an action we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, it muſt not be done. This without doubt hath woſully inſuared your peoples Conſciences, and is one great reaſon they are ſo full of fears and ſcruples: They have been taught not to rely upon impartial Reaſon, but to ſeek ſtill for a place of holy Scripture to be their guide and warrant. So Mr. <hi>W. Bradſhaw</hi> (a famous Divine,<note place="margin">Defence of his Book of Lots againſt Mr. <hi>Balm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
                  </note> whoſe name I know you reverence) confeſſed to Mr. <hi>Gataker; that he was often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſatisfy ſome in their Caſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him, though he gave them
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63803:69"/>never ſo good reaſon for his Reſolutions, becauſe they would not therewith be ſatisfied, unleſs he could produce ſome place in Scripture for every particular</hi> 
                  <q>Thus infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, doubts, and ſcrupuloſities muſt needs ariſe in mens minds (as Mr. <hi>R. Hooker</hi> well expreſſes it) and ſtops and rubs without any end be caſt into the courſe of mens lives concerning their ordinary and civil affairs, if the light of Reaſon ſhall be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and men ſhall be conſtrain'd, burn it never ſo clearly, not to proceed by it in ought they are to do, till they have had ſolemn acceſs, firſt to the written Word, and fetch'd light from ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſentence in it, for the farther confirmation of them therein.</q> And thus I may add, the Scripture came to be baſely wreſted and bended from its proper ſenſe and meaning, to ſerve their particular occaſions. And, in their great Ignorance, they went away better ſatisfied with a fanciful and impertinent application of it to their preſent buſineſs; than if the ſoundeſt Reaſon in the world had been offered to them. Only, this in time was the miſchief of it, that by this means they found a Way to juſtify unlawful Actions, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Confidence in thoſe wayes, againſt the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Reaſon. But it's poſſible you will not regard what I ſay, nor Mr. <hi>R. Hooker</hi> neither, being one of thoſe you call blind and ſuperſtitious writers. Let me ſend you therefore to Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> who tells you that if you underſtand not your Liberty about things in themſelves indifferent, <hi>there will be no quiet in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, no end of Superſtitions.</hi> Many indeed think, ſaith he, that <hi>we are fond to move diſputation about the free eating of fleſh, about the free uſe of dayes, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch other ſmall trifles, as they think them: But there is more weight in them than is commonly thought. For when Conſciences have once caſt themſelves into the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63803:70"/>ſnare, they enter into a long and cumberſome way, from whence they can afterward find no eaſie way to get out.</hi> 
                  <q>If a man begin to doubt, for inſtance, whether he may uſe linnen Sheets,<note place="margin">Inſtit. L. 3. cap. 16. Sect. 7.</note> Shirts, Handkerchiefs and Napkins; neither will he be out of doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may uſe thoſe of Hemp, and after that of coarſer ſtuff, Nay, he will begin to weigh with himſelf whether he cannot ſup without Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, and be without Handkerchiefs. If he think dainty meat to be unlawful, at length he ſhall not with quietneſs before the Lord eat either Brown-bread, or Common meats, when he remembers that he may yet ſuſtain his body with baſer food. If he doubt of <hi>pleaſant</hi> Wine, afterward he will not drink even that which is <hi>dead,</hi> with peace of Conſcience; laſt of all, he will not be ſo bold to touch ſweeter and cleaner water than other. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, at the length he will come to this point, to think it unlawful (as the common ſaying is) to tread upon a ſtraw lying a croſs. For the Queſtion is not light and ſmall, being no leſs than this; whether God will have us do this or that, whoſe Will ought to guide all our Counſels and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63803:70"/>Doctrines; ſaying, that no part of the Counſel of God muſt be ſuppreſſed, and conceiving the People would be defrauded, if they were not admitted to theſe diſputations. They make no difference, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>

               <p>Hear me a little and then judg. Theſe poor men were in a manner conſtrain'd by your rude cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, to take upon them to expound the word of God, though very unable for it; and thereby expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed too early even Preaching it ſelf to the laughter and ſcorn of thoſe that had ſome <hi>Wit</hi> to diſcern, but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63803:71"/>no <hi>goodneſs</hi> to pitty their Weakneſs. They were loth to hear themſelves called <hi>Idol-Shepherds,</hi> that had Mouths but could not ſpeak a word from God; and ſo rather than endure this reproach they entertain'd the people with their Gloſſes, Paraphraſes, and Diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, upon the holy Scripture; and called <hi>all</hi> the Word of the Lord, though never ſo abſurd and ſenſleſs. Silence I confeſs had better becom'd them, than ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to ſpeak what they did not underſtand: but yet conſider how hard it was to reſiſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to open their Mouths as oft as they could; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at once they might both avoid the contempt and odious brand of a <hi>dumb dog;</hi> and alſo get a great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, with the Ignorant multitude, of an able, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter of God's Word.</p>
               <p>And as for thoſe who had ſome abilities to expound the Scriptures and exhort the People, they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon with ſo much earneſtneſs to <hi>preach the Word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> that they knew not at laſt what to preach. They were forced to ſtep up into the Pulpit and make a <hi>noiſe,</hi> when they had little or <hi>Nothing</hi> to ſay. By which means the Holy Writings were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied according to their preſent fancy; and handled in a very careleſs and Superficial manner. A bold Face and a ready Tongue were fain to ſupply the place of good Reaſon and well digeſted Thoughts.<note place="margin">Fire of the Sanctuary uncovered p. 310.</note> 
                  <hi>Loudneſs</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Corn. Burges</hi> once told you) <hi>was made to ſerve inſtead of matter.</hi> For they found if they were but earneſt, the people accounted them very zealous preachers, <hi>and imputed their want of matter to their wiſdom and deſire of edifying: Not to their want of ſtudy or ability.</hi> And it was their cuſtome to ſay, <hi>He preaches to the Conſcience, He ſtands not upon deep learning: He reproves ſin boldly;</hi> and if it was other
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63803:71"/>mens, not theirs, ſo much the better. For the very truth is, the people do not love to hear nothing but their duty; or to hear it frequently repeated. And ſome taught them in time to call this <hi>Legal-preaching;</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Sermons were then to be <hi>contrived;</hi> nothing but Chriſt and free Grace to be <hi>preached.</hi> And becauſe they grew weary even of hearing theſe ſo often over; there, was a neceſſity to device Novelties, or elſe not preach ſo many Sermons. The laſt would by no means be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and ſo the Scriptures were to be ſqueazed, new notions invented, delicate new phraſes coyn'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a new Religion made to pleaſe the people. Could it, for inſtance, have entred into the head of any man, from thoſe words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> before mentioned, to talk of Believers being big with ſin; and to make ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations as theſe, <hi>that it is our Glory to be Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Ewes;</hi> and that when a man is big with young, and cryes <hi>O my belly, my belly;</hi> here is a point of comfort, that Chriſt is ſweet to ſuch perſons; could a man I ſay have ever thought of ſuch things as theſe, but that he was to ſtrain the words as far as ever fancy could ſtretch them; becauſe he muſt have ſoon done with the Text, had he given only the proper ſenſe of it; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſoon done with him, had he not ſought out ſome new Inventions? They were at leaſt to be court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome ſweet and indearing phraſes, and called O <hi>Bleſſed Ewes,</hi> O <hi>Believing Ewes,</hi> and O <hi>Believing Bees, that ſuck the honey of ſin hatred, out of the Wormwood of ſin acted:</hi> And told, that Chriſt accounts their ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings ſweet: <hi>Meih, Meih,</hi> ſaith the little one, and the mother counts it <hi>Muſick.</hi> And ſo no doubt do the people count this puleing ſort of preaching. O he, is a <hi>ſweet man</hi> ſayes one, an <hi>affectionate man</hi> ſaith a ſecond; a <hi>melting preacher</hi> ſaith a third; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he layes them to the Dugs of Chriſts Love, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63803:72"/>bids them ſuck, or but open their mouths and cry <hi>Meih;</hi> of if they cannot, aſſures them Chriſt will do it for them: Not conſidering all this while, that he entertains their fancy with the fulneſs and freeneſs of thoſe Breaſts, and leaves their thoughts hanging and admiring there; meerly becauſe he is dry and empty himſelf, and hath nothing elſe to ſay.</p>

               <p>That's a part of your pride and ſelf-conceit, to call truth by the name of wrath, paſſion and bitterneſs. And to pretend withall that whoſoever ſpeaks any thing againſt you, is an enemy of God, unacquainted with Religion, a formal, ſuperſtitious, or moral man. But take it as you will, and think of me as you pleaſe, I ſay that, in my obſervation, there is ſcarce a dram of that virtue called <hi>Modeſty</hi> to be found, I will not ſay in <hi>one,</hi> but in a <hi>whole</hi> Country of you. You are generally <hi>full</hi> of your ſelves, highly conceited of your own underſtanding; impatient of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in ſo much that my <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> tells us he knew ſome of your way, <hi>who thought it a tempting of God to hear or read what might be ſaid againſt them.</hi> By which you may ſee this is no new humour, but runs in the very ſpirit of the party: who cannot think that any underſtand ſo much as themſelves of the things of God; and imagine the Spirit guides them which muſt not ſubmit to reaſon; and that no man hath any true Goodneſs in him, that is not one of them. Upon which account they ever ſuppoſed all men of whom they had any good thoughts, to be of their way in their hearts; nay, all other of any parts to be againſt them, meerly for the love of the World.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63803:73"/>This I will evidently prove to have been, a long time, the humour, even of your eminent Profeſſors; if it ſhall be contradicted. And it is the cauſe I believe that they complain ſo heavily if any man reprove any of them: as if there could never be found even in good men, ſomething worthy of Reproof; or as if that which we reprove in them, were an undoubted part of their goodneſs. But they will take the liberty, not only to <hi>reprove,</hi> but to <hi>rail</hi> upon us, as much as they pleaſe: &amp; ſay, when they have done, as Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> did to the Aſſembly, <hi>I bope you will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me,</hi>

               <p>But as to the buſineſs of <hi>Judging others,</hi> ſince you mention it and it is ſo much talkt of, I openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that I <hi>judg</hi> no man in things indifferent; as you are wont to do, and as the <hi>Jews</hi> judged the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf.

Is it like good Chriſtians think you, to call thoſe <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, Will-worſhippers, Complices of the Beaſt,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare they do not believe any <hi>Ceremony</hi> they uſe, to be any part of <hi>Divine Worſhip,</hi> nor neceſſary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it; but that they may be altered by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to which they are bound to yield Obedience: And in the mean time to cry out on thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you for down-right Oppoſition to Authority, for clamour, evil-ſpeaking, apparent pride, and ſuch like things; which the Laws of Chriſt judg and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and tell us are <hi>manifeſt fruits of the fleſh?</hi> You cannot think ſo (ſure) unleſs your underſtandings be ſo ſtrangely blinded by the love of your ſelves, that the cleareſt Truth cannot enter, if it ſhew you your errors. Indeed if a man merely omits to do thoſe things that are commanded; but is not unruly, croſs, clamorous, an oppoſer of Laws, a maker of Parties, and ſeparate Congregations, nor in any other behaviour unchriſtian; I think, I ought to leave him to be judged by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who ſearches the

               <p>Be not ſo fierce. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I cannot tell whether Prophaneneſs abound more now, than it did in the days when you reigned. I told you the laſt time what
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63803:75"/>the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> told the <hi>Parliament</hi> of the ſudden growth of wickedneſs ſince they began to ſit. And I am ſure it was not checkt in the following years; but the <hi>ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exhortation</hi> of the greateſt part of the <hi>London Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> complained no longer ago than 1660. of the great Wickedneſs broken looſe among us; (which it ſeems was chained and bound up while the Biſhops govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and, as a great inſtance of it, tell us in the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſad Lamentation, that <hi>ſome (as we are credibly inform'd) are grown to that height of wickedneſs as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Devil himſelf,</hi> p. 10. And then, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether the Wickedneſs that hath ſo much abounded beyond that in Elder days, be not in great part to be imputed to your ſelves: For all the time you declaimed againſt the Ignorance and blindneſs of the people, you caſt many fearful ſtumbling-blocks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them (as an honeſt <hi>Suffolk-man</hi> told you ſome years agone) while they could not but ſee or hear your ſcornful cenſuring and condemning others; greedy panting after and gaſping at the Riches, Honors,<note place="margin">Mournfull Complaint to the Knights and Burgeſſes of that County, 1656.</note> and Preferments of this World; fraudulent circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and over-reaching your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; cruel revenge upon thoſe you judged your Enemies when you had power; bitter quarrelling and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one againſt another: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all thoſe ſins, which might have juſtly cauſed you to lye in the Duſt, they ſaw you lifted up, boaſting of the glorious times you had made, proudly appropriating to your ſelves the honourable name of Chriſtians, Saints, and the godly Party. Nay, the people were not ſo blind but they could ſee how you meaſured the <hi>Saint-ſhip</hi> of your ſelves and others, rather by ſome private opinions or ſmall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63803:76"/>punctilio's of worſhip; than by the great things of Faith, Righteouſneſs, and Mercy. For they found ſome men whoſe profeſſion of Chriſtianity was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with theſe, accounted no better than civil men; while others were cryed up for Saints and Godly, who were much deficient in them. Beſides, your Miniſters took no care to <hi>Catechiſe</hi> the youth in the Country: Nay, brought <hi>that Ordinance</hi> into ſuch Contempt, that to this very day a man is not thought to do his <hi>Duty,</hi> who ſpends the afternoons of the Lords day, in that <hi>inſtruction.</hi> They heard nothing but <hi>Orations</hi> in the Pulpit morning and evening, and thoſe (God knows) very ſorry ones in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As for <hi>the Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> a great many honeſt-hearted people were frighted from it. You made ſuch lofty Rails (as he obſerves) about the Table, that few or none of the poor people could come at it: As if you thought it a matter of great piety to confine the Members of Chriſts Body to a little room, and cauſe his Death and Paſſion to be known and remembred only by a few: As if it were an honour to Chriſt and an advantage to the world; that his name and memorial ſhould periſh from the hearts and mouths of a great part of the people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his Name, and ingaged in Covenant to him. Nay, in many places, they never ſaw it adminiſtred to any at all, for many years: Your Miniſters chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to deprive themſelves and others of whom they had a good opinion, of this <hi>Heavenly Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet;</hi> than afford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it to many well-meaning, though no talking people. And ſo while they complained of their living in known ſins; they themſelves lived many years in a notorious omiſſion of this Duty. Sometimes indeed they would invite men to this feaſt; but then by their preaching they hindred and diſcourag'd the moſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63803:76"/>if not all in a Country-congregation; as if they were too forward to acknowledg the benefits of Chriſt, and keep up his remembrance. In ſhort, many of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the people no better than <hi>Heathens,</hi> and upon that ſcore would not baptize their children; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by indeavoured to make them ſo, and quite thruſt them out of the flock of Chriſt. O that you would all ſearch your hearts (as that honeſt man ſaid, to find out the true root of this <hi>Spirit of Separation,</hi> and obſerve narrowly whether under other ſpecious pretences or with ſome pious intentions, there were not a bitter root of pride and haughtineſs, cauſing you to affect ſingularity, and deſire to appear alone to the view of men; thinking it below your worth to be found in Communion with thoſe, whom in opinion you have laid ſo much below your ſelves.</p>
               <p>But let that be as it will; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I cannot readily tell which are worſe, the <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots,</hi> or the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> This I know, that there have a long time been a great many of the laſt, who juſtified themſelves and lookt upon all others as abominable.

               <p>I underſtand a little Latin; and beſides I have ſeen the latter part of his Comments on the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah</hi> tranſlated into our tongue; where he tells us, towards the Concluſion, <q>That there were ſome among them under a pernicious Miſtake, abhorring only theſe <hi>groſs things,</hi> to wear brave clothes, to fare deliciously, to drink and ſwill, to whore, to heap up riches carefully, to be Uſurers, and others of the like Kind; but in the mean time, Arrogance, faſtidious diſdain of their Brethren, to languiſh about frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous queſtions, factions, reproach of God's Word, ſlanders againſt his Miniſters, eaſily to believe lies, and being raſhly believed or (or perhaps by an evil ſuſpition ſuggeſted) to ſpread and ſcatter them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; <hi>theſe</hi> and ſuch like things, ſaith he, paſs with them ſometimes for <hi>Virtues.</hi> Nay, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>thrice Holy,</hi> while they walk about with a ſtoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Superciliouſneſs, bended Brows and ſad Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; while they wear mean clothes, and rattle all mortals in the ear, not ſo much with grave Words as with claps of Thunder; crying out, that <hi>all is naught and wicked.</hi> That which I have experience of, as he goes on, and have good aſſurance of its truth by certain obſervation, why ſhould not I teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the Glory of Chriſt and the Admonition of the Brethren? Of thoſe who abound ſo much in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the vices of others, whom every Garment that is a little more neat, every little Entertainment that is more plentiful, every Word that is more merry and pleaſant doth much offend, that are always complaining concerning the want of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; I have found very few (that I may not ſay none) who do not labour with remarkable conceit
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63803:77"/>of themſelves, inſufferable contempt of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, incredible impatience of any neglect of them, and ſometime with other more grievous Evils. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they are in a manner alway addicted to new and ſtrange Opinions; which tend only to Schiſms and nothing to Edification. Now Hereſie is a fruit of the fleſh, and doth far more miſchief than all Drinkings, Whorings, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries.</hi> On the other ſide, among thoſe perſons whom they deteſt no leſs than <hi>Heathens</hi> becauſe of a life more remiſs, and the riches of the World, and a certain ſplendor or bravery; I have found very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who as they acknowledg themſelves obnoxious to <hi>ſin,</hi> ſo they think of themſelves moſt <hi>humbly,</hi> and of their Neighbours moſt <hi>Benignly:</hi> they are very can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did in their Thoughts and equal in their Judgments concerning others; always accounting themſelves the worſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when the Croſs that they have deſerved lies upon them; nothing is more patient than they; none hazard themſelves more for the Lord. Theſe things I have certain knowledg of, and why may I not declare them to his Glory? And I call him to witneſs, that in ſpeaking this, I mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than to ſet any brand on a more ſevere mortification of the fleſh, and renouncing of worldly things; or to incourage thoſe that live remiſly, or indulge any deſire of the fleſh: No, I pray the Lord that he would give me and all his choſen grace, to uſe ſtill more ſparingly, the things of the body, our ſelves, that we may impart them more liberally to the Poor.

               <p>You have repeated ſo often the <hi>Schiſm</hi> (as you call it) or <hi>Separation</hi> that is made from your Church; that I perceive it is the great thing that ſticks in your ſtomack, and which angers and frets you ſo much. And indeed Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> told us it would do ſo, in one of thoſe Sermons you mention ſo oft. <hi>The Saints and people of God,</hi>

Now when we withdraw from men and from their worſhip, we condemn their Worſhip; and the men of the world do not love to be condemned. To ſeparate from them and from their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, this they cannot bear. The Saints do ſeparate from them, and therefore there is ſuch a deal of anger and wrath in their hearts againſt them.</hi>

               <p>Alas! Good man; Doth he think we have ſuch an opinion of him and his Saints, as they have of <hi>themſelves?</hi> He flatters himſelf too much. It is one thing to <hi>imitate</hi> the Saints, and another thing to <hi>counterfeit</hi> them. He ſhall never perſwade me that quick-ſilver is better than gold; and that turbulent and affrighted Imagination can be a ſurer guide either in the choice or exerciſe of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than a calm Reaſon, and a fixed well-reſolved Judgment. Let him call himſelf and his party <hi>Saints</hi> a thouſand times, or as oft as he breathes; it ſhall never move me at all, nor ſhall I think the worſe, but the better, of my ſelf for being none of them. Let him pride himſelf in new devices, of a different worſhip for the Saints and the reſt of the world, I am very well contented, if they will but <hi>withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> far enough from us, and let us be out of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Gibberiſh. Let him lead them to the <hi>Indies</hi> if he pleaſe, and be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from us by the wide Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; it will be a great ſatisfaction to enjoy our worſhip
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63803:79"/>quietly<note n="*" place="margin">Yet you muſt not hope for this; For they muſt ſtay to power forth the Vials, which next to the Separating from us, is the thing that provokes the Antichriſtian party.

Or rather let him retire into his Cloſet, and think no company in the world pure enough for him but his Books, and no Books but his own; his preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I aſſure him, ſhall never trouble me at all. And I ſuppoſe I may paſs my word for our whole Church, that they will not complain for want of his company; nor think it any diſgrace to our Worſhip that ſuch do not like it, or perhaps abhor it; nor any ſhame to themſelves that they will have no Communion with us. There were alwayes people of <hi>a moreſe and ſowr humour</hi> whom nothing can pleaſe; no not what they do themſelves, when once it pleaſes others too. They muſt be of a contrary Opinion to the whole race of mankind: And hate ſome things, only becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love them. And therefore if they not only <hi>withdraw</hi> themſelves from us, but alſo <hi>ſlight us</hi> and ſet us at naught; the concern is not ſo great, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire my care. Let them call Us <hi>the World,</hi> and if they pleaſe, <hi>the Dogs</hi> that are without the Holy City; I value it no more than the barkings of an angry Cur: Though in his vain conceit of himſelf and party, he imagines we lay their diſreſpect to us mightily to heart. For this you know is another cauſe which he is pleaſed to aſſign, why the men of the world are angry with them. <hi>The Saints and people of God do not regard the men of the World; and the men of the World they think ſo. Now for high and lofty men to be ſlighted and not regarded, this makes them angry.</hi> For which he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63803:80"/>cites <hi>Dan</hi> 3. and then repeats it. <hi>They cannot bear this, that they ſhould not be regarded; high and great men, that they ſhould not be regarded: and therefore no wonder there is ſuch a great deal of wrath and anger in their hearts againſt the people of God.</hi> But let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it as oft as he will; tell him from me, that it moves us not at all to want their regard; for we do not think our ſelves honoured by their Eſteem and Reſpect. It is rather a reproach than an honour to be commended and praiſed by ſuch mouths, as value a compoſed countenance and a Sett of phraſes; more than the moſt compoſed and regular life, and the beſt ſenſe in the world. Let them ſlight us therefore ſo much, if they liſt, as not to move their Hat, or give us the time of the day, or turn their face another way when they chance to meet us; it is all one, we ſhall have never the worſe opinion of our ſelves or of our Worſhip. We do not think them ſo able to judg of true worth, or to diſcern between true and falſe, good and bad, as to concern our ſelves about their Opinion: theſe being almoſt the ſame thing now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, and though all undertake to judg, yet few know the difference. We have ſomething elſe alſo to ſupport us than their favourable opinion of us; and that is, a ſincere care with unblaſſed affections to ſearch after the Will of God; and a readineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and do it, whenſoever we know it. Let him bring us Reaſons in ſtead of confident aſſertions, and ſee if we will not ſtudiouſly conſider them; and if they be good, yield to them. He ſpoke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably who ſaid, that <hi>our Reaſon ought to yeild obedience to nothing but Reaſon:</hi> and that <hi>Authority is a yoke which none but God hath a right to impoſe upon our judgments.</hi> If God ſay it, that's reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: but we ſhall never be perſwaded that they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63803:80"/>only hear or underſtand what he ſayes. Let them talk as if they had not only ſlept in our Saviour's Boſom (as <hi>a Gentleman</hi> I remember ſometime ſaid) but even watch't in his heart and ſoul, and as if there were none of his intentions hid from their knowledg: They will never gain the greater credit with us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ſee more than words and confidence. No, though they ſhould not only contemn and ſcorn us as altogether ignorant in the things of God, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Anathema's and Curſes againſt us as the limbs of the Apocalyptick Beaſt; Heaven we know laughs them to ſcorn, and we ſhall ſmile at their ridiculous preſumption.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63803:81"/>to be indifferent things, and ſo when their kinsfolk, or friends invited them, not deny that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, to accompany them to their Temples.

You would be more aſſured that this is the ſenſe, if you would but turn to the place from whence theſe words are cited (as the Margin directs you) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.11. where the Prophet bids not the more holy ſort of <hi>Jews</hi> to ſeparate from their prophane Brethren; but the whole Body of the <hi>Jews</hi> to flye out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> as any body may ſee that reads the place: And therefore they cannot be urged without a notorious force to prove ſuch a ſeparation as you are in, of one part of a ſociety profeſſing belief in Chriſt, and baptized into his name, and renouncing all Idols whatſoever; from the other.

                  <hi>All that can be inferred is, that we ſhould avoid need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs familiarity with the wicked, and all ſ ciety in ſin: To keep them from the Sacrament if we can.

                  <hi>And they which are the Temples of the living God, and in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appear as lights in the world, having the word of life; nothing doth infect them, which they tolerate for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nities ſake; nor are they pent up in any ſtraight, becauſe God doth dwell in them and walk in them. And they depart in the mean time out of the evil, and are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, at leaſt, in heart; leſt haply while they would ſeparate by the ſedition of Schiſm, they ſhould rather be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually ſeparated from the good, than carporally from the bad.</hi> This old Divine alſo admoniſhes us very well out of the ſame. Father, that when the multitude of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Church are free from that crime to which Excommunication is denounced, it is very healthful; and becauſe ſo many avoid him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will be ſtricken with fear, and healed through ſhame. But when the ſame ſickneſs hath taken hold of very many, there remains nothing elſe to the good, but ſorrow and be wailing; that ſo they may eſcape that deſtruction which is like to come on the multitude of the wicked. And in very deed, ſaith he, if the contagion of ſinning hath invaded the multitude, the ſevere mercy of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſcipline is neceſſary: but the counſel or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes of ſeparation are both vain and pernicious, yea <hi>ſacrilegious;</hi> becauſe then they become both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63803:83"/>and proud; and give more trouble to the good which are weak, than they correct the ſturdy ones who are evil. And concluding this point, he gives this Advice; Let a man therefore with Mercy correct what he can; and that which he cannot, let him bear with patience: And with love let him mourn and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, until He from above do either redreſs and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; or elſe differr until the harveſt to root out the tares, and to winnow out the chaff. And here he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the example of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that holy Martyr, who had been Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and deſcribes the multitude as full of groſs ſins, yea many of his fellow Biſhops as ſpotted with very foul crimes; but yet he communicated with them (though not in their ſins which he evermore reprehended, yet) in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and holy Worſhip of God. Nay, he ſhews that our Saviour himſelf did not ſeparate in Body from the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Saduces</hi> and multitude of common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but met with them at the Temple: And it is alſo plain, that the <hi>African</hi> Church in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their evil manners, had ſome other blemiſhes which cannot be charged on ours; for by his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint it appears, there were ſuch a multitude of Rites and Ceremonies then in uſe, that they were a very great burden, and the Church was oppreſſed and groaned under them. And therefore I think your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs in ſeparating from us is more like the diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and proud Religion of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> than the humble and charitable purity of our bleſſed Saviour.</p>

               <p>No bolder than Mr. <hi>Calvin;</hi> who will give you good ſatisfaction, if you read the Chapter to which I referred you, that the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in our

And I will ſhew you diſtinctly, either now or when you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, that thoſe Churches planted and watered by the Apoſtles, had thoſe Corruptions in <hi>Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Manners, Diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> which cannot be pretended to be in ours: And yet there was no ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſome Members from the reſt: Nay, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, notwithſtanding all theſe, ſpeak very well in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of ſome They call them all <hi>Believers</hi> and <hi>Saints:</hi> And none knew then any other <hi>Men of the World,</hi> and <hi>

               <p>I am loth to give you ſo great a trouble. But I pray anſwer me one Scripture which ſeems to be againſt this; when it ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtles ſeparated the Diſciples,</hi> Act. 19.9.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Admirably argued! The Apoſtles, ſeparated the Diſciples from thoſe that were not Diſciples; and therefore we may ſeparate Diſciples from Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The Apoſtles, I ſay, were ſent to preach the Goſpel and make Diſciples to Chriſt, baptizing them into his Name who believed on him. Thoſe who would make profeſſion of Chriſt they gathered into a new Church from among the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> who diſown'd him. And accordingly here in this City having won ſome to believe, and made them Chriſts Diſciples, they ſeparated them from the reſt of the <hi>Jewiſh Synagogue,</hi> who blaſphemed Chriſt and would acknowledg no other Religion but that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> to be a diſtinct Society by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63803:85"/>themſelves, and no longer Members of the <hi>unbelieving Synagogue.</hi> From whence you would inferr, that one Chriſtian is to be ſeparated from another Chriſtian, and believers gathered from believers; if one part appear to us Pious, and the other Vicious: Which is juſt as if the Apoſtles, out of thoſe few Diſciples ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the <hi>Jews,</hi> had made another leſſer Church, ſeparated from the reſt of the <hi>Diſciples.</hi>

               <p>I ſee my Error plainly: And ſhall remember hereafter if I can, not merely to nibble at the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as you called it, but take it altogether. But Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> affrights us horribly with one place, which propheſies he ſayes of the greateſt ſeparation in the latter dayes, that ever was. It is in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where the Spirit cryes, <hi>Come out of her my people, that you be not partaker of her ſins. There ſhall be the greateſt ſeparation, and that provokes the Antichriſtian party;</hi> as his words are, p. 179. of the Book before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>

               <p>I remember them very well, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. But do you ſtill take Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> for a Prophet? Have I not ſhown you what a rare <hi>Seer</hi> he is in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>

               <p>You need ſay no more; I have it perfectly in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63803:86"/>mind as well as you. And you were wont I know, in thoſe days to believe that they knew the deſigns of Heaven, as well as if they had been Counſellors of State in that kingdom: And conceived the News they told you of what was coming, as ſure and certain, as if they had layn in the Boſom of St. <hi>John</hi> as he did in our Saviour's. But I hope by this time you are convinced they were only drowſy dreamers, that knew nothing of his Mind: And ſee that they are but like a poor Mouſe which having but one hole, is eaſily caught. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, Babylon</hi> was all they had to ſay then, and thither they run now. Theſe are the <hi>Magical ſounds,</hi> whereby they would aſtoniſh you: The <hi>Myſtical words</hi> whereby they practiſe all their Sorceries upon you. Stop but your ears againſt theſe, and you are free from their Enchantments; for they can never prove that the <hi>Church of England</hi> is this <hi>Babylon</hi> from whence his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are call'd, or that ſhe hath taken ſo much as one ſip, or kiſs'd the Cup of her Fornications.</p>

               <p>No, You took it very lovingly upon their word: And ran after thoſe whom you fancied and were ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of, with an implicit Faith; as if you had taſted too deep of the Cup your ſelves. If you did but hear them ſay, <hi>Myſtery, Myſtery,</hi> (the very word you know in the forehead of the whore) preſently you bowed to them, and thought you were under the teachings of an infallible Spirit. And you remember I ſuppoſe very well, that thoſe two and all the reſt of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> that were wont to preach before the Parliament, and in the greateſt Congregations, generally choſe their texts out of the <hi>Old-Teſtament,</hi> ſeldom out of the <hi>New,</hi> unleſs it were the <hi>Revelation.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>By which means they furniſhed themſelves in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63803:86"/>an abundant meaſure with ſuch Compariſons, as did them admirable ſervice. They could eaſily contrive it ſo, that they might ſeem ſuch a ſelect number as the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the peculiar people of God; and we like the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> or what other accurſed Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they pleaſed. And ſo applying all thoſe places which ſpoke of them, to us and our times; they excited in you the ſame hatred againſt us that was in the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt thoſe Nations; and made you think it as neceſſary to ſeparate from us, as for the <hi>Jews</hi> to come out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> Nay by a wonderful Art, or prodigious Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather (which argues your great dulneſs) they firſt raiſed your fancies, put words into your mouths, and taught you to expect all that they had a mind ſhould ſhortly come to paſs; and then they made the expectation they had wrought in you an argument that it ſhould come to paſs. Thus I remember one of your Divines incouraged the Parliament to expect the overthrow of <hi>Babylon, becauſe ſaid he, the General talk throughout the Houſhold among the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks is,</hi>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63803:87"/>beſeech you, to whiſper this and afterward talk it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that Chriſt was coming to ſit upon his Throne? Had you any Revelation of it? Did you that are his <hi>Domeſticks</hi> hear Chriſt the King ſay ſo? Or were you not told ſo by theſe pretended Favourites of his, and believed them without asking whence they had the News?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>

               <p>And then when your heads were fill'd with this conceit, and they had ſet your tongues a going, and made this the general Talk; they ask't you (if you were apt to deſpond) Why do you doubt of it? Be of good chear; without queſtion he is not far off; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe you would never have talk't ſo much of his coming. Which was no more in <hi>plain Engliſh</hi> than this; you would never have believed us, if it were not ſo. Were not theſe rare devices to ſupport the people's confidence? And were not the people very blind that could not diſcern this foul Impoſture? Never talk now of the Sottiſhneſs of the multitude in the <hi>Romiſh Church;</hi> for they are couſened by neater Legerdemains than this. Which is juſt as if I ſhould entertain a Child a long time with hopes of Plums and fine Toys coming from ſome Fair: and when he began to doubt of it, ſhould tell him; thou haſt talk't of them ſo long my Child, that without queſtion they will be here by and by; How is it poſſible that thou ſhouldeſt be in ſuch expectation of them, if they were not at hand?</p>

               <p>Not I. But I love to rub up your memory, that you may reflect how your beloved phraſes are applied to all purpoſes; and ſee that an <hi>Idol Miniſter</hi> can ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing, but one that doth no more of the work of a Miniſter, than the people, it ſeems, did of your work of fighting againſt the King; till they were alarm'd by ſuch clamours as theſe, and affraid to be thought <hi>Idolaters,</hi> or an <hi>Idol-people.</hi> In ſhort, he is ſuch a perſon as the Shepherds of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were, when they neglected their Office, and took no care of the flock committed to their truſt: From whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, nor to renounce all communion with them, and obedience to them. But beſides this I would have you know, that if there be any Miniſters among us that are but like <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of men: there are thoſe (and thanks be to God good ſtore) who hear and ſee and ſpeak, and do the will of God, in the places where they are ſet.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I am convinced of all this.</p>

               <p>But I pray once more obſerve whether all ſuch Writers and Preachers as Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> and the reſt of the ſeparation in which you are ingaged, do not take more pains to prove the danger of Idolatry and the hainouſneſs of the ſin; than to tell you what I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry is, and to prove that it is Idolatry to joyn
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63803:89"/>with us. Their way alwayes was to prove little and to accuſe ſtoutly; to declaim loudly, and not to reaſon; to terrifie the people by a dreadful ſound of words and raiſe great paſſions in them; not to inform their judgments what they are to do and what to avoid. And for that purpoſe nothing hath ever done them better ſervice than <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Calves,</hi> and <hi>Idol</hi> Miniſters, <hi>Idol Service</hi> and ſuch like words of no certain and determinate meaning. And to ſay the truth, in this, (as Mr. <hi>Can</hi> himſelf could not but obſerve a great while ago) conſiſts a great difference between Chriſts inſtitutions, and mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions: <hi>Whatſoever God will have us do or not do, he layes down the ſame openly, preciſely, manifeſtly, but when Satan ſpeaks by his Inſtruments, he ſpeaks ſo ambiguouſly and cloakedly, that one knows not how to take it, nor which way to apply it</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">So I find his words ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Mr. <hi>J.

               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>Envy and Anger that any men ſhould be liked better than themſelves.

               <p>There is an old ſaying, that <hi>No man ever ſought another in the Oven, who had not been there before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Had not your Preachers been heretofore tickled with the ſight of full Congregations and the fancy of having many followers; they could never think Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes and throng'd Aſſemblies (which many do not want) ſo neceſſary to the contentment of any man of worth among us. And were not you intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably proud and conceited of your ſelves, this imagination could never have entred into your heads,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63803:90"/>that it dejects our Miniſters to want your company. What are you that they ſhould tremble to hear you ſay in a threatning manner, <hi>We will never hear him more?</hi> Are you the only men of Wiſdom; the ſole Beauty of Chriſtian Aſſemblies? Is all their labour loſt, if you be not there to commend it? Are the reſt of the people no better than the walls and the ſeats? Speak man: Is it a great courteſie to a Miniſter that you will be pleaſed to hear him? Muſt he think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beholden to you that you vouchſafe him your preſence? Nay take it for an honour that you come and help to make a numerous Auditory; in which you ſhine, as the precious ſtones in a Ring? O prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Vanity! I have heard indeed that ſome of your Miniſters made low reverences to you and ſtudied to humour you, as if they thought you deſerved much of them for honouring their Aſſemblies; but I know none of that mind: If you will not come to hear them; you may ſtay away, and I wonder who will have the worſe of it, you or they?</p>

               <p>If they are not concern'd in this, why do they keep ſuch a ſtir about Separation? Cannot they let the people do as they will, and ſay nothing? To what purpoſe is it to make ſo great a noiſe about ſuch little things?</p>

               <p>How ſay you, little things? Hear Mr. <hi>J.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63803:90"/>of his true pleaſing and acceptable worſhip, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in his ſervice. It is no ſmall offence to forſake the prayers of the Congregation, to depart from the Table of the Lord, when he calls to feaſt with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and to break off Society and communion with the Church of Chriſt, to fill the hearts of weak Chriſtians with doubts and diſtractions, as not knowing what to do, or what way to take; to ſpend time in reaſonings and diſputings of this kind which might much more profitably be imployed in the practice of Repentance and holy obedience; to expoſe Religion to contempt, and the truth of God to reproach among them that delight to ſpeak evil. Theſe are ſad effects of this Separation which I oppoſe: Which tends not (as he ſpeaks in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Can,</hi>) to the overthrow of Antichriſt, but to the renting of the Church, the diſgrace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the advancement of Pride, Schiſm, and contention, the offence of the weak, the grief of the Godly who are better ſetled, the hardning of the wicked, and the Recovery or riſing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſm.</q> As for other evils (which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not) ſuch as the alienation or abatement of affection even where there is the neareſt bond of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and the ſowring of mens minds towards their Governours, in whom they cannot ſo heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce as they ought, while they take them to be the impoſers of Idolatrous Ceremonies, or ſinful worſhip; I will not diſcourſe of them neither: Not becauſe they are light matters; but becauſe I have many things to add and would not be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>

               <p>I remember ſomething in Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> to this purpoſe, and I confeſs it affected me <hi>then,</hi> and made me fearful to fall into the ſeparation: Eſpecially
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63803:91"/>becauſe of another ſad effect which was uſually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in thoſe days to follow theſe Diviſions, among the people of your Perſwaſion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I heard ſome ſay, that when men ſaw thoſe who were ſo well conceited of their own knowledg, ſincerity and piety above others; miſtake ſo groſsly, and be ſo rigidly preciſe, as to make that Sin, which God never made ſo; they fell into diſlike even of all the Good that was in them: And diſcerning how little reaſon they had for this ſtrictneſs, preſently imagined they had as little for the ſtrictneſs of their lives and converſation in all other matters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>They told you the truth, and you ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it now. There is nothing more difficult than to ſever good and evil when they are mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The good is frequently rejected by ſome for the Evit's ſake; and the evil received by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the ſake of the good. Men are wont ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to like or diſlike all that they ſee in thoſe of whom they conceive a good or ill Opinion. They that love the Piety of ſome Miniſters, fall in love alſo with their Preciſeneſs; and they that hate their Preciſeneſs, may fall into hatred of their Piety.</p>

               <p>Did you think me of ſo perverſe a humour, as to ſhut my eyes againſt the light of the Sun, becauſe an Enemy opens the Windows to let it in? I will ever embrace and juſtifie a truth, come it from whom it will: And I pray know once for all, that I do not approve of thoſe who out of hatred to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of your people, brand all that are of ſtrict and Holy Lives, with the Name of <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Phanatick</hi> or ſome ſuch like. But it would do
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63803:91"/>well if you would conſider, that which was the occaſion of this diſcourſe; how much hurt you do by being ſo rigid where there is no need. This tempts inconſiderate people on the one ſide to think it is but needleſs ſcrupuloſity that makes you careful in other things which Chriſt indeed hath tyed us unto: at leaſt they will put off your reproofs for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, by accuſing you of more preciſeneſs than you have reaſon for. And on the other ſide; you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the unexcuſeable looſeneſs of ſome that are enemies to your ſuperſtition; are tempted thereby to ſtrengthen your ſelves the more in it, and to ſtand the more ſtifly in your ſeparation from us. So that both ſides are the worſe for theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and increaſe their evil humours by theſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>

               <p>I muſt tell you one thing more. While men on both ſides have by their contentions and hatreds gone farther and farther one from the other; they have faln at laſt into moſt fearful Extremities. On your part, ſome have proceeded to that degree of deteſtation, as to condemn us of Idolatry and Antichriſtianiſm, and have faln not only into all the dregs of <hi>Browniſm</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> but into the dotages of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the men of the <hi>fifth Kingdom.</hi> And on our part, ſome have drawn ſo far from you, as to fall back into <hi>Popery,</hi> perhaps into <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> at leaſt indifference about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; which are diſeaſes too frequent alſo among your ſelves. If therefore the credit of Religion (as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> again ſpeaks) the Glory of God, the Souls of our Brethren be dear to us, <q>What can we do leſs than by a juſt defence of the Truth, ſeek the reclaiming of ſuch as are gone aſtray, the eſtabliſhing of them that are weak in judgment,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63803:92"/>but zealouſly affected to the ways of God; ſtop the ſtream of ſeducing, free the Godly from unjuſt imputations, ſettle peace and unity in the Truth among Brethren; I may add, to keep the whole Nation, if it be poſſible, from ſuch dangerous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipies as they are drawing towards.</q>

               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I hope you have a good meaning: But you ſhould conſider that I and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are not withdrawn to ſuch a diſtance from you, as you ſay ſome are. We do not ſeparate from the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> nor think that you are not the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt; which was the error of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Schiſntaticks.</hi>

               <p>You ſhould have added, of Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> and the reſt of his partakers as I have plainly ſhown you: and I wiſh I could not ſay of <hi>ſome Presbyterians</hi> too, who once abhorr'd ſuch rents as they have now made. For what did they mean to call us <hi>Babylon</hi> ſo oft, if they would not have the people think (whatſoever they thought themſelves) that we were <hi>Antichriſtian?</hi> Expound to me all the paſſages already mentioned; particularly that of Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> juſt now cited: Tell me what you think <hi>of the diſtinct and audible voice from beaven which they heard to call you to come out of Babylon.</hi> Why did he make the war between the King and You,<note place="margin">Engl.

                  <note place="margin">Preface to the Book of Diſcipline.</note> 
                  <hi>then Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip and damnable Idolatry was ſet up?</hi> And to paſs by the ſpeeches of your
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63803:92"/>railing <hi>Vicars,</hi> why did Mr. <hi>Fr. Woodcock</hi> (in his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures at St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> before named) call the Biſhops and their Partakers I cannot tell how oft, the <hi>Popiſh faction,</hi> the <hi>Antichriſtian faction,</hi> the <hi>Antichriſtian party who ſlew the witneſſes, i. e.</hi> ſuſpended and ſilenced ſome Miniſters for not conforming to the Laws? Laſtly, why were theſe Lectures Ordered to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and every Pulpit ſuffered to ſound with ſuch like language? If all theſe things were ſaid in heat, the better to ſtir up the people's paſſions; ſay ſo, and we have done. You ſhall never hear a ſyllable of the late times from me; if you do but ingenuouſly confeſs your raſhneſs, and humble your ſelves for theſe and ſuch like faults. Or if any of you were then of the mind that Epiſcopacy was Antichriſtian (as it is affirm'd in the <hi>view of the Covenant, p.</hi> 34.) a Limb or Claw of the Beaſt, as the <hi>Browniſts</hi>-phraſe was, but now are of another opinion; let us know it, that we may rejoyce in the change. <hi>Wiſe men ſometimes change Opinions and Counſels, though Fools do not.</hi> And they will change for the better as Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> hath done for the worſe. For there was a time when he and his Brethren made this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration before God and all the world concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engliſh Churches, <hi>In which,</hi> ſay they, <hi>through the grace of God we were converted; that all that Conſcience of the Defilements we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to cleave to the</hi> True Worſhip <hi>of God in them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apologet. Narration 1643. pag. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>or of the unwarrantable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Church-Governours exerciſed therein, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work in any of us any other Thought, much leſs Opinion; but that multitudes of the Aſſemblies and Parechial Congregations thereof were the true Churches and Body of Chriſt, and the Miniſtry thereof a true Miniſtry; much leſs did it ever enter into our hearts to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63803:93"/>judg them Antichriſtian.</hi> Why they ſhould ſay <hi>Multitude,</hi> and not <hi>all</hi> ſince they had the ſame form of Divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and were under the ſame Government, I know not; for it cannot be meant of ſuch. Churches where the Miniſters were choſen by the People, which were but few. Nor am I concern'd to know the ſenſe of thoſe words; but I would gladly know if they pleaſe, why they cannot now ſee multitudes of ſuch Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and by what new light or Revelation Mr <hi>Bridge</hi> hath diſcoverd our Worſhip and Churches to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, from which the Saints muſt come forth and ſeparate themſelves. Or rather (for now you would have me ſpeak to you alone) why ſo many <hi>Prosbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> withdraw themſelves from our Prayers and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and hold ſeparate Aſſemblies in oppoſition to ours? You do not make your cauſe the better but the worſe by this acknowledgment, that you do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us as no true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt: and ſtand condemned by your own declared Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and all the writings of your Forefathers. <hi>To forſake the true Churches of Chriſt</hi> ſaith Mr <hi>J.

What ſpot do you ſpy in her now, which you could not diſcern heretofore? Or if there be any, what ſoul Monſter ſhould it be that thus affrights you, if indeed we be not the Beaſt, nor any limb of him? You that profeſs ſo much <hi>tenderneſs of Conſcience,</hi> ſhould rather methinks, be horribly afraid, ſince you think we are a Church ſtill united to Chriſt, leſt by ſeparating from us, you cut your ſelves off from him, and run in time to the greateſt extremities, and utterly renounce and diſown us. For as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>They that have once broken off from us, have run from one error into another, after the fond imagination of their heart, till they have daſht themſelves againſt the Rocks.</hi> And indeed how can you expect it ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſe. <q>There is but one Body, the <hi>Church;</hi> but one Lord or Head of the Body, <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Whoſoever ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates from the Body therefore, ſeparates from Chriſt in that reſpect. And if we withdraw our ſelves from him where he graciouſly invites us to feaſt with him may we not juſtly fear he will withdraw himſelf from us, and make us ſeek when we ſhall not find him? This voluntary ſeparation from the Lords, Table and the Prayers of the Congregation, is a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63803:94"/>willing excommunication of our ſelves from the Viſible tokens of the Lords preſence and Love. And if it be a grievous ſin in Church Governors to deprive any Member of the Church of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Viſible Church upon light and unneceſſarv occaſions, is it not a greater ſin in the Members to deprive themſelves of the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion upon the like or leſs occaſions?</q> Without all doubt, this ſin will be puniſhed with blindneſs of mind if you perſiſt in it. Such offenders having run (as I am able to prove) from one thing to another with the greateſt confidence, till they came to think themſelves inſpired and full of the Holy-Ghoſt, even when they rail'd and reviled all other Churches: And when thoſe heats ſailed, to think that all Religion was a mere Hypocondriacal Deluſion. This Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> aſſured you long ago would be the fate of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts from ſuch a Church as Ours; <hi>Becauſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſacred Bond of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity; no man ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape this juſt puniſhment of his divorce, that he ſhall intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf with the moſt peſtilent errors, and moſt foul dotages.</hi> Nay, your own Miniſters could admoniſh you heretofore; <hi>that when Religion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by choice or force is propagated in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Antapologia. p. 29. p. 117.</note> as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> informs us, having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Merchant and his Wife, joyning with him at the firſt, ſeparated from Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> and ſet up a new Church of their own: Of which a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (Mrs. <hi>White</hi>) was the ſoundreſs as Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> himſelf hath ſaid.

               <p>But you are concern'd to keep in mind theſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals in ſeparate Congregations. And it will do you no hurt, I am ſure, to reflect a great deal farther back; and conſider what work the ancient <hi>Separatiſts</hi> of our Nation made in the ſame Country: <hi>Johnſon</hi> and <hi>Ain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworth</hi> fell out at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and their Congregation was divided into two, one of which excommunicated the other. The two <hi>Johnſons</hi> alſo, though Brethren in nature as well as Religion, fell into ſuch a fiery conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a ſmall occaſion, that <hi>George</hi> the younger, became a Libeller and loaded his Brother and others, with many reproaches, and that in Print; to remain for ever. The Elder broke fellowſhip with him and with his own Father (who took part with <hi>George</hi> and curfed the other with all the curſes in Gods Book) and this breach was confirm'd by the heavy ſentence of Excommunication, and both Father and Brother deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to the Devil. But then at <hi>Leiden, J. Smith</hi> condemned them all, and accuſed them of Idolatry; telling them that their Conſtitution was as very a <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi> as either her Mother <hi>England,</hi> or Grandmother <hi>Rome;</hi> and that the Separation was the <hi>youngeſt and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt daughter of Rome the Harlot.</hi> The reaſon was, becauſe they look't into their Bibles when they preach't, and into the Pſalter when they ſung; For <hi>the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>were not to be retained as helps before the eyes in time of worſhip, and particularly that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to have a Book before them in ſinging of Pſalms.</hi> Beſides, their Government he thought was <hi>Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> becauſe they joyned to <hi>Paſtors,</hi> other <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Rectors,</hi> which was an human invention. And ſo he fell to the Anabaptiſts; where he made alſo a new ſect, by baptizing himſelf if you pleaſe to have ſome of his words, perhaps they may be uſeful to you; <q>When <hi>Popiſh</hi> prelacy, ſaith he, was ſuppreſſed, and the <hi>Triformed

And therefore, as they that ſubmit to the <hi>Prelacy</hi> are ſubject to that wo of <hi>Worſhipping the Beaſt;</hi> ſo they that ſubmit to the <hi>Triform'd Presbytery,</hi> are in like manner liable to that wo, denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that <hi>worſhip the Image of the Beaſt.</hi>

               <p>That's ſtrange!

Now what ſecurity I beſeech you, have any of you, that the Congregations you begin to draw from us, apart to your ſelves; ſhall not break in time into as many little fractions, and produce theſe bitter fruits which I have mentioned? What charm, what power have you to keep out this evil Spirit, which alwayes haunted the ſeparation? All the Authority which your Miniſters may think they have, hath no foundation but the Paſſions of the common people. It depends for the moſt part on the fancies of rude Artiſans, and Ignorant Mechanicks. Theſe will make their Divinity for them; and they muſt ſtill be inventing new conceits to entertain their Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They are ſervants to ſuch a world of Maſters, that it is evident they have reaſon to fear their own ſide, as much as ours. And when they have done all they can, they are liable to be thought Impoſtors, as oft as any man thinks he is <hi>taught of God,</hi> and hath a new light ſhining into his mind. Then ſhall you ſee again all thoſe wild fancies fly about which are now in great meaſure fall'n to the ground. <hi>Old England</hi> may become as mad as the <hi>New:</hi> And ſuch a woman as Mrs. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> that ſhall take upon her to repeat

               <p>That which hath been done more than once, may be done again.

All that they can do is but to joyn their Votes together with many other, to ſettle that Religion which is ſound and good, it being the foundation of all Laws and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bond of human Society: And when it is eſtabliſht to take the ſame care that it be preſerved from ſudden and unneceſſary alterations in any thing belonging to it; which are alwayes dangerous not only to Religion, but to the Civil Peace. Now ſince it is plain they judg it not fit to promote a change becauſe of ſome mens diſlike, and none ought to be deſired, in my poor judgment, againſt the Opinion and without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of our Spiritual Governours; who have more Wiſdom, and not leſs Piety ſure than we, what have you and I to do but to ſeek peace and unity ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way without alterations?

               <p>I would have you ſettle your ſelves (and not be thus wavering) in this perſwaſion, that it is lawful to joyn with us in the Worſhip of God, as <hi>now eſtabliſhed:</hi> And then reſolve that it belongs only to thoſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the Conveniency of things, who have <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to do what they beſt like, and <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to weigh all circumſtances and make choice of the beſt courſe: And that if they miſtake, their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſhall not be imputed to you, who have nothing to do in ſuch matters. After this, weigh ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and often, the great miſchiefs of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which far exceed all the Inconveniences which can be fancied in all our Ceremonies. And then your Miniſters muſt indeavour to make their acquaintance and followers of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and confirm them in it by coming to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, and informing them that all the ancient <hi>Puritans</hi> (as they were called) did not hold it unlawful to joyn with with us, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; to ſeparate from us. Nay, let them teach them that it is a great deal better to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things which poſſibly they had rather let alone, than quarrel and break the peace of the Church of God. They have the Example of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63803:99"/>it, who finding, that during his exile from <hi>Geneva,</hi> they had brought back the uſe of the <hi>Wafer-Cake</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread, would not contend about it, though he did not like it. He knew as well as you, it was not commanded by God, and that there was no neceſſity of it; nay, that this ſort of bread had been the invention of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and abuſed by them to Superſtition and Idolatry; and that they made <hi>unleavened bread</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Sacrament, and urged it as of <hi>Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> for which cauſes he diſlik'd it; but yet he would not ſtrive, though it would not have been to break a cuſtom, but only to go back where he left them; becauſe he ſaw it would make a rent. Would you would but imitate his <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> and we ſhould ſee an end of our <hi>Diſputes;</hi> Eſpecially if you would not be ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory; for there can be no peace while you affirm with ſo much confidence, that this and that doubtful thing, is the <hi>Mind of the Lord.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was content (as my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> I think, ſomewhere obſerves) to ſpeak in this manner in ſome caſes, <hi>Thus ſay I, not the Lord:</hi> and <hi>according to my counſel.</hi> But now men do ſo lightly ſay, <hi>Not I, but the Lord,</hi> yea, and bind it with ſuch heavy denunciations of his judgments; that they diſtract poor ſouls that would willingly do all that God would have them, and make Differences ſo wide, that we can never come together. Be modeſt therefore in your affections, deſires, and all your carriage and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. Speak well alſo of the preſent Miniſters that conform in every thing to the Law, who approve themſelves to God and men by their diligence and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Be not ready to proclaim the negligence or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps evil manners of any. Hear all their Inſtructions with Reverence, and if your be otherwiſe minded in any thing, keep it to your ſelves, and make no ſtir about it. In ſhort, Do all that ever you can without ſinning;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63803:100"/>and if you do not condemn nor ſeparate from thoſe who do more than you; then your Omiſſions may be pardoned, and you may more reaſonably expect indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or accommodation, when you do your Duty as well as you are able, than now that you are diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and obſtinately refuſe to obey Authority in things you acknowledg not unlawful.</p>

               <p>That's a queſtion to be askt them, rather than me. And their Forefathers in Non-conformity, thought ſuch places unskilfully alledged againſt them by the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and that they were nothing to the purpoſe: Their Caſe (and ſo yours) being ſo different from the Apoſtles. <q>For <hi>firſt,</hi> They that inhibited the Apoſtles (they are the words of thoſe Miniſters concerning the laſt place) were known and profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Goſpel.<note place="margin">Ib. part. 2. pag. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were charged not to teach in the name of Chriſt, nor to publiſh any part of the doctrine of the Goſpel; which commandment might more hardly be yielded unto than this of our Biſhops, who are not only content that the Goſpel ſhould be preached, but are alſo Preachers of it themſelves. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles received not their calling and Authority from men, nor by the hands of men, but immediately from God himſelf, and therefore might not be reſtrained or depoſed by men: whereas we, though we exerciſe a function whereof God is the Author, and are alſo called of God to it, yet are we called and ordained by the hand and miniſtry of men, and therefore may by men be alſo depoſed, and reſtrained from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our Miniſtry.</q>

               <p>Would we could but hear you Diſcourſe now thus wiſely and ſolidly: It would gain you great reſpect and make every body in love with you, whatſoever differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences there were between us. But to hear men only babble in Scripture-language; ſo ignorantly as if they were mere Novices in Chriſtian Religion, and yet ſo confidently as if they were Apoſtles; it cannot
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63803:102"/>but diſguſt all rational perſons. Beſides, would not any man think that many of your Miniſters were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried more by Humour than Piety, and regarded more their own intereſt, than that of Religion, when he hears them crying out, <hi>neceſſity is laid upon us;</hi> and <hi>wo be to us, if we preach not the Goſpel;</hi> and yet they preach it only where there is no need, and that with a greater breach of the Laws, than if they preached in other places? Why do they not inſtruct the country people (if they muſt preach,) where they ſay the Cures are worſt ſerved? I doubt they ſee their condition would be <hi>Woful</hi> indeed, if they preach'd the Goſpel there; and therefore they ſhould have added two words to the Apoſtles ſpeech and ſaid, <hi>Wo be to us, if we preach not the Goſpel, in</hi> LON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON. There is little to be got by preaching it to the poor Countrey folk. Thoſe are barren places to ſow the ſeed in, and will bring forth ſmall profit to themſelves. And ſo they would do well to ſay in <hi>plain Engliſh</hi> (and I ſhould think them honeſter men if they did) <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon us:</hi> to tell you the truth, <hi>We muſt preach to get a living.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>I find that they apiſhly imitate the Apoſtles without their ſpirit: And run about with their <hi>words</hi> in their mouths, when they leave the <hi>ſenſe</hi> behind. As if when they want the things the Apoſtles had, it were ſome comfort to them that they can keep their glorious Phraſe and Stile. Did they never
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63803:102"/>conſult think you one with another, what to do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>And what are they, I beſeech you? Are they turned on a ſudden into Spirits? Have they left the <hi>Body,</hi> ſince they left our Churches; and become ſeparated Subſtances, ſince they became Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>What do you mean?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, what do <hi>you</hi> mean, thus vainly to affect the Apoſtles phraſe? Who intended nothing elſe, when he ſaid, (1 <hi>Gal.</hi> 16.) that he did not <hi>conſult with fleſh and blood</hi> after God was pleaſed to give him an immediate commiſſion to preach Chriſt, but that he did not conferr and deliberate with any mortal men, like himſelf, whether he ſhould go about that work or no. And truly in this ſenſe I doubt your Miniſters conſulted too much <hi>with fleſh and blood,</hi> when they conſidered whether they ſhould conform to the Orders of the Church or no. They applied themſelves to your humour, and thought whether you would not be diſpleaſed to ſee them do that which they had raſhly condemned or ſlighted; and hear them <hi>preach up that, which they had deſtroyed.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> indeed ſtood not upon this, and would not hearken to what men ſaid: But they I doubt had more of his words than of his mind; and ſate liſtning a great while to the voice of fleſh and blood about this matter. And I wiſh they did not conſult too much with it about other things: And did not baulk diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Doctrines. Otherwiſe, why do they not teach you in an honeſt manner as the <hi>Old Non-Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> did: That the Ancient Church of God uſed a Form of Prayer and Praiſes, as every body
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63803:103"/>knows<note n="*" place="margin">There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſay they, confeſſions, prayers, pſalms, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſolemn bleſſing u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their Synagogues.</note>? And that our Saviour bad his Diſciples when they prayed to ſay, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> which he would never have done, if it had not been lawful for us in making our Prayers to God, to uſe the very ſame Words? And that is an abſurd and frivolous Exception to ſay, We never read that the Apoſtles did uſe a Preſcript Form of Words; For if this be ſufficient to excuſe us from doing what Godex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commands or manifeſtly permits, that we never read the Apoſtles or Saints did it; then we muſt not, or need not Baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, becauſe we never find they uſed thoſe words; or that they Baptiſed Infants; or that they prayed, or rendred acknowledgments to the Holy Ghoſt. And farther, why do they not teach you that even upon extraordinary occaſions, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire great and ſpecial fervency of Spirit, it is lawful to uſe a Form of Words, as our Bleſſed Saviour did in his Agony <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.42.45.<note n="*" place="margin">And ſo the Prophets had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as they gather from 14. Hoſ. 1. &amp; 2. Joel 17.</note>? And again, not only thoſe Forms which we frame our ſelves, but which have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by others? as <hi>Solomon,</hi> they obſerved, <hi>Jehoſophat, Hezekiah,</hi> all uſed the very words that <hi>David</hi> had done before. Nay, further yet, that the people of God have uſed a ſet Form of Words in extraordinary occaſions, which were appointed long before thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fell out. <hi>Daniel</hi> for inſtance uſed the words that <hi>Solomon</hi> had commended in caſe of Captivity<note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 9.5. compared with 1 King 8 47.</note>: and <hi>Ezra</hi> uſes the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63803:103"/>Form of Thankſgiving, which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſay they; to be uſed after their return from Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity<note n="b" place="margin">Vid. Pſal. 136. comp. with 33. Jer. 11. and 3. Ezra. 11.</note>. And more than this, that it is lawful to uſe not only thoſe forms which are in the Scripture, but ſuch as in the compiling and collecting them, the Invention and ſuch other Gifts of men are uſed. <hi>There being a liberty</hi> (as the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> themſelves heretofore confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) <hi>left in the Church to do many things, that tend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſetting forth Gods Ordinances.</hi> As in preaching of the Word, and in thoſe Prayers, which they call <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayers;</hi> the Wit, Memory, judgment, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther human gifts are lawfully and neceſſarily uſed. Eſpecially conſidering, that the peoples Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Memory may be better helped by that they are well acquainted withal, than by the other. And then, if forms thus deviſed by men be found to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and profitable; what ſin can it be, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the Church to command that ſuch Forms be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or for us to uſe them (being perſwaded of their lawfulneſe) when they are impoſed? Unleſs any body will ſay, that therefore it is unlawful for us to hear the Word, receive the Sacraments, believe the Trinity and all other Articles of the Faith, becauſe we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Magiſtrate ſo to do: Whereas indeed we ought the rather to do good things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Word, when we know them to be alſo commanded by the Chriſtian Magiſtrate. Theſe are the very words of your ancient Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Browniſts</hi> or <hi>Separatiſts</hi>

               <p>Acknowledg it, man? I would not only have them ſay ſo when they are ask't, (as it were a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Confeſſion whiſpered in the Ear) but publiſh it aloud on all occaſions; that ſo they may call back thoſe ſheep that are gone aſtray by their means. Let every one of them, the next time you meet, ſpeak to the people in their own language and ſay, <hi>Come, let us go up out of this Babel, and confuſion; Let us return to Sion; though it be with weeping and Supplication. There the Lord dwelleth, and there he is truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</hi> For whatſoever they may acknowledg ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, the poor people (whom I pity with all my ſoul) are ſtrangely and paſſionately poſſeſſed with an opinion of the ſinfulneſs of being preſent at our Divine Service. Many of them eſteem one of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, how well ſoever qualified and diligent in his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63803:104"/>calling, however blameleſs and exemplary in his converſation; no better than a <hi>Corrupt man,</hi> a <hi>Time-ſerver,</hi> a <hi>Formaliſt, Popiſhly affected,</hi> or at leaſt, a man <hi>blinded</hi> and deceived through Ignorance. Nay, there are thoſe who call them the <hi>Sons of Perdition</hi> and make them men of no Conſcience. Some have queſtioned whether they may marry a Conformiſt; as if they were the people of a ſtrange God. To hear ſuch a Miniſter they look upon as a great crime: At leaſt they think, if any other be to be found, they muſt go to the <hi>Non-Conformiſt,</hi> though far the weaker man. And as if they thought that to be godlineſs in themſelves which they call tyranny in other men; there are ſome that <hi>impoſe</hi> this upon their Children, never to hear the <hi>Common-Prayer:</hi> And charge them, as I have heard, upon their bleſſing, to obey them in this Command. And when for very ſhame they 01 cannot but acknowledg the gifts of ſome Miniſters; then they limit the uſe of them only to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of mens Minds in the letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diſcovering groſs ſins: But that they may convert Souls, and work Faith and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in them, they very much doubt, if not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny. Nay, ſo far doth this conceit carry ſome of them, that they will ſcarce give a friendly countenance or ſalutation to us: And they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call any ſmall company of their own party; the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>people of God,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of ſuch a town: As if we had no portion in Chriſt, but they had got him wholly to themſelves. Theſe Humours were obſerved in the <hi>old Separatiſts;</hi> and ſince they abound in you alſo, there is great need to warn you to purge out the old leven leſt it be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from generation to generation.</p>

               <p>Was not <hi>Cartwright</hi> of his mind?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>No. For he declared his meaning was not to diſallow of a <hi>preſcript form of Prayer,</hi> and an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform Order</hi> in the Church. His quarrel was onely with ſome things in our Service-Book. But yet he profeſſed he did not oppoſe the Ceremonies as ſimply unlawful, but only as inconvenient. And therefore perſwaded the Pretchers rather to wear the Surpliſs than ceaſe their Miniſtry, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to receive the Sacrament kneeling, if they could not have it otherways: becauſe though that geſture was, as he conceived, incommodious, yet not ſimply unlawful. All which and a great deal more I will prove out of his own works and other good Authors, if it be contradicted; as alſo that he loſt his Profeſſors-place at <hi>Cambridge</hi> upon other accounts, and after all went to <hi>Warwick</hi> where he was born, and dyed in the diſcharge of his Office as their Miniſter. And Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> I remember tells us that he citing a paſſage out of Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright's</hi> Comments on the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> in a Sermon he preached a little before the Wars to perſwade the people to take heed of the <hi>White Devil,</hi> viz. <hi>the ſeparation upon greater pretence of Purity;</hi> Mr. <hi>John Goodwin</hi> came to him when he had done, and gave him great thanks for it. As for Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed went further and ſaid, the Ceremonies were unlawful either to be impoſed, or uſed. But he was far from being ſo great a Schollar as this man fancies; at leaſt his learning was not well digeſted. For taking upon him to maintain, that <hi>Popiſh</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is every whit as bad as <hi>Pagan,</hi> he brings a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to juſtifie this, that a <hi>Heretick is worſe than a Pagan.</hi> Which are the Words of another man, whom Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63803:109"/>that place confutes, and asks him by what rule he concluded this, ſeeing our Lord ſaid, If he hear not the Church let him be to thee <hi>as an Heathen,</hi> not <hi>worſe than an Heathen;</hi> By which you may ſee how how forward men of this ſpirit are; to catch at any thing that may ſeem to favour their Opinions, and to make a ſhew of learning when they think it will ſerve them, though they ſlight and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it as a carnal weapon, when it is in their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries hands. And if I thought this man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him, I ſhould imagin he had learnt of Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> to magnifie thoſe of his own party beyond their deſerts: For he extolls the refuſing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity as ſuch a ſingular piece of ſervice done to God, that he compares ſuch perſons as were therefore deprived, to <hi>David, Worthies,</hi> and the three hundred men that followed <hi>Gideon.</hi> Moſt brave flouriſhes! How can you chuſe but yield your felf captive to ſuch <hi>Champions;</hi> believing this Preface upon his word, that thoſe he Muſters up were in the number of the <hi>Worthies.</hi> But he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> too; as I am able to prove from good Teſtimony, even from himſelf. But for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities ſake I ſhall only let you know that Doctor <hi>John Burges</hi> aſſures us, that on his own knowledge and in his hearing, Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> denied to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any man againſt the uſe of the Ceremonies; and profeſſed he would be loth to be put to the ſolution of this Objection (as he called it) <hi>wear the Surpliſs, or Preach not.</hi> Which is an argument that though he did not like them, yet he did not hold them unlawful, much leſs Idolatrous, as this Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Writer would perſwade us. I can prove alſo that he abuſes Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> but that I make haſte to tell you; the moſt palpable forgery of all, is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:63803:109"/>the putting Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> into the Catalogue of his <hi>Mighty Men.</hi> And ſince he pretends to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Latine, I will ſend him for his more full conviction to an Author no leſs learned than that excellent Doctor, and a far better Schollar than any of the reſt; and that is Doctor <hi>Richard Crackan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp,</hi> who tells the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Spalato</hi> that the Doctor was no <hi>Puritan</hi> (as he called him) but he himſelf a <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niator.</hi>

And then, he ſpake againſt not one word there againſt the Hierarchy. Nay, he acknowledged it to be conſonant to the word of God, in his conference with <hi>Hart.</hi> And in an Anſwer to <hi>Sanders</hi> his Book, of the <hi>Schiſm of England</hi> (which is in the Arch-biſhops Library) he profeſſes that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of the <hi>Book of Conſecrating and ordering Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons.</hi> He was a ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver alſo of all the Orders of the Church and Univerſity, both in publick and his own Colledg: wearing the Square Cap and Surpliſs, Kneeling at the Sacrament, and he himſelf commemorating their Benefactors at the times their Statutes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and reading that Chapter out of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus,</hi> which is on ſuch occaſions uſed. In a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo of his to Arch-biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> (then in Doctor <hi>Crackanthorps</hi> hands) he profeſſes himſelf conformable to the Church of <hi>England, willingly and from his heart,</hi> his Conſcience admoniſhing him ſo to be. And thus he remained perſwaded to his laſt breath; deſiring to <hi>receive Abſolution</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63803:110"/>to the manner preſcribed in our Liturgy, when he lay on his Death-bed. Which he did from Doctor <hi>Holland</hi> the King's Profeſſor in <hi>Oxford;</hi> kiſſing his hand in token of his Love and Joy, and within a few hours after reſigned up his Soul to God. What think you now; was Doctor <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> one of thoſe that abominated our Worſhip, ſuffered <hi>extream perſecution, deprivation and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too?</hi> Or muſt he that lately ſtood among the moſt <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>godly men</hi> in the World, be now blotted out, and put in the black liſt of Idolaters, <hi>and touchers with Graven Images?</hi> What ſay you?

For they have told us in Print,<note n="*" place="margin">Chriſtian Modeſt Offer (as they call it), of the ſilenced Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in which they call for another diſputation. <hi>Anno</hi> 1606.</note> that <hi>Moſt of thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> appointed to ſpeak for them at <hi>Hampton Court</hi> were not of <hi>their chuſing,</hi> or <hi>Nomination,</hi> or <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the matters then in queſtion;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63803:110"/>but of a <hi>clean contrary.</hi> For being intreated at that time to diſpute againſt thoſe things <hi>as ſimply evil and ſuch as could not be yielded to</hi> without ſin, they profeſſed to them, they were not ſo perſwaded, and therefore could not do ſo. And being then requeſted to let his Majeſty underſtand, that ſome of their Brethren were further perſwaded touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unlawfulneſs of thoſe things than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they refuſed that alſo. Now I would fain know of this <hi>Epiſtler,</hi> whether he do not think Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> was one of thoſe <hi>Moſt?</hi> and whether he do not ſee that ſuch men as he were aſhamed the King ſhould know; that any of the Nonconformiſts (to whom they wiſht well) were ſo weak as to call the things in difference <hi>ſimply evil?</hi>

               <p>Nothing at all. For by whom are <hi>their</hi> Prayers framed? Are they Angels or glorified Saints in the Church Triumphant, that muſt not have the name of <hi>Men?</hi> Or dare they ſay, the Spirit frames them? And do they not repeat for ever the ſame phraſes, only not put together always in the ſame Order? How many thouſand times have you heard them beg, that they might <hi>prize Chriſt more,</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances more,</hi> and <hi>Sabbaths more</hi> and a number of ſuch like things as theſe? And beſides all this, what ſay you to the <hi>Pſalms of David?</hi> Could no man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently joyn devoutly in ſinging them, becauſe they were ſo often repeated, and ſo well known that the <hi>Jews</hi> had them by heart?</p>

               <p>I cannot tell; <hi>But God himſelf,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>judges it neceſſary to conſult his glory (I mean a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious awe, reverence and eſteem to his counſels and works from men) by concealing the one and the other, till the time of their bringing forth, that ſo they may come freſh and new to them.</hi> VVhat ſay you to that?</p>

               <p>That's falſe. For he foretold many things by the Prophets. But were it altogether true; it's nothing to the purpoſe. For though he ſurprizes us ſometimes with events we never thought of, and could not foreſee; and will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

He judges it neceſſary to declare it, and hath made no new Declaration ſince the Apoſtles times. And yet we may have a Religious reverence, ſure, to his Counſels revealed in his Word, though they come not freſh and new to us. If we cannot; all that I have to ſay is, that then the ſame Exception lyes againſt <hi>them,</hi> which you bring againſt the <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi> Nor are your own Prayers ſo freſh and new as he pretends; but we know beforehand the moſt you have to ſay; only you have ſome new invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Words and Phraſes which ſometimes give us juſt diſguſt.</p>

               <p>It is more than noiſe. For he tells you (<hi>pag.</hi> 11.) <hi>that it is as well or as much the incommunicable priviledge or prerogative of God to preſcribe, appoint and command his own worſhip, as it is to be worſhipped. And therefore whoſoever ſhall authoritatively under any penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties command any Form, Model, Method or Manner of Divine Worſhip makes himſelf God; and whoſoever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to ſuch Worſhip is an Idolater, becauſe he gives that honour to a creature which is due to God alone.</hi> What have you to ſay againſt this Argument?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay that as no body doubts but God, who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, hath a right to appoint <hi>his own Worſhip,</hi> ſo it is as certain that he hath not appointed any <hi>model of Worſhip</hi> or form of words to be uſed in Prayer and none elſe. Nor hath he told us that he will not be worſhipped by a ſet Form, or that we muſt vary our words and phraſes, and <hi>conceal what we have to ſay to him till we bring it forth.</hi> And therefore I ſay he hath left it to our ſober and Religious Reaſon to determine after what manner that worſhip which he requires may be beſt performed. And if not to every mans reaſon (which would be abſurd) then thoſe who govern the reſt are to conſider how chriſtian Societies when they meet together may moſt ſolemnly pray in the name of our Lord Jeſus for ſuch things as are according to Gods will; and give thanks alſo to God the Father through him. And conſequently it is no incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable prerogative to appoint a <hi>Form or Order</hi> of Divine Worſhip, ſince God hath not appointed one himſelf, and yet muſt not be worſhipped diſorderly. And if it may be appointed, then it may be appointed under
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63803:114"/>penalties, to keep men from wanton contempt of the publick Reaſon. Mr. <hi>J. G.</hi> you remember compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a hymn to be ſung on a day of Thanksgiving in his Congregation. This was a form, and authoritatively impoſed; elſe every one there might have brought forth his hymn and put all into confuſion: which if they had done they might juſtly have been cenſured by him, if he had had any power. Now I would fain know why the Magiſtrate may not preſcribe the Song of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> or any other godly Hymn to be ſung by all Congregations committed to his charge; as well as one Miniſter preſcribe an hymn to his particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? and why the Magiſtrate may not uſe all his power and puniſh as he ſees cauſe; as well as ſuch a Miniſter uſe all his (who could only reprove) in caſe of contempt? I would know alſo how this Author could excuſe the whole Chriſtian World from being Idolaters, you <hi>Presbyterians</hi> not excepted, if his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be true. For the Parliament preſcribed the <hi>Directory,</hi> and that not without penalties, as a <hi>model or manner</hi> of Divine Worſhip: and ſo <hi>they</hi> uſurped the place of God; and <hi>you</hi> who ſubmitted to their orders, <hi>Worſhipped the creature,</hi> and ſaid conſtructively and in effect (if he reaſon right) to the Parliament, <hi>Thou art my God,</hi> or <hi>I acknowledge and own thee for my God.</hi>

               <p>And what would have become of you, if after this dreadful ſentence, he had not in an extraordinary fit of good nature revoked it; and allowed the uſe of a preſcribed form? For though he ſay <hi>that conceived prayer, for the nature and kind of it, is that very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which God Commands.</hi> Yet as he doth not prove it, ſo he affirms it not confidently, without this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction; <hi>at leaſt to thoſe that are, or by the uſe of means may be, capable of it, p.</hi> 30. Very kindly ſaid; I
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:63803:115"/>perceive this gift then of conceiving prayer is but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and no divine inſpiration: and where nature is not ready in its conceptions, it may be relieved by the help of Art: and ſome may be uncapable of it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever means they uſe to acquire this gift. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently conceived prayer is not the Worſhip which for the nature and kind of it, God commands; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not command impoſſible things: but another manner of Worſhip by a conſtant form may be uſed; nay, impoſed too when a Magiſtrate judges it needful, and ſees that thoſe who are moſt zealous for conceived Prayers alone, have generally leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities to conceive aright. In ſhort he grants, <hi>p.</hi> 55. that <hi>ſtinted forms of Prayer in themſelves, unto ſome men, and under ſome circumſtances may be lawful:</hi> He might as well have ſaid needful, for I ſuppoſe-he thought them lawful, in caſe men could not conceive prayers themſelves, as they ought. And then why may not the circumſtances be ſuch that they may be needful <hi>to all;</hi> at leaſt at ſometimes, when men of the readieſt inventions are indiſpoſed? And mark I beſeech you how timerouſly he begins to ſpeak after all his vapouring, when he tells us, <hi>We ſhall hardly find in the Scripture, eſpecially in the New Teſtament, the ſame Prayer uſed by the ſame perſon the ſecond time.</hi> It ſeems we may find it, if we will but take the pains. But to ſave us a labour he preſently remembers, that Chriſt prayed the <hi>ſame words</hi> a ſecond and a third time: which he excuſes thus; by the <hi>ſame words</hi> we are to underſtand the ſame in ſenſe, matter and import, but not in ſound, letters or ſyllables. How he came to know this I cannot tell; for my part I believe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was not concern'd about new words when he had the ſame thing to ſay again. But the like perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concluſion he makes concerning all the exhortations
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:63803:115"/>to prayer delivered by Chriſt or his Apoſtles: which he ſaith were intended <hi>only</hi> of that kind of prayer which the Saints were to conceive and indite <hi>by the help of the Spirit,</hi> which they who believed did receive. To countenance this he cites a great many Scriptures, and tells us that thoſe places (at leaſt the moſt of them) cannot be underſtood of the Miraculous gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> which is ſo notoriouſly falſe that I wonder he had the confidence to affirm it. The <hi>firſt</hi> is <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. the <hi>next, Act.</hi> 5.32. which no man I think before him ever underſtood otherwiſe than of the extraordinary gifts beſtow'd on the day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt. And of ſuch gifts the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. In ſhort, there is but one place of all that he muſters up, that can with any colour be drawn to ſerve his purpoſe, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 8.14, 15. And yet to me there is no Senſe ſo plain of thoſe words as <hi>this;</hi> that all the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt being a great Evidence of the truth of Chriſtianity, they that lived accordingly, might be aſſured of the love of God; and whether they were <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> might call God <hi>Father,</hi> though they obſerved not the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But I moſt marvel that he ſhould alledge that place in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. which the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> I remember, were wont to cite (and with more ſhew of reaſon) to prove that every Saint had the Holy Spirit to open to them, and lead them into every truth.

               <p>I had rather hear what you can reply to the Scriptures which he brings to prove, <hi>that therefore God abominates a worſhip or a form and manner of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe he hath not commanded it.</hi> Though the Worſhip were in its own nature abominable, yet he takes no notice of that; but only of its <hi>not being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:63803:116"/>which is a ſign the provocation lyes there. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31. <hi>Jer.</hi> 19.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pag. 19.20.</p>

               <p>I remember the places very well; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber withal that this is a miſerable old argument which hath been anſwered many a time before he ſet pen to Paper. And it hath been proved with plain Evidence, that the meaning of the words, <hi>which I commanded not,</hi> is as much as, <hi>which I forbad:</hi> as he had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their offering their children to <hi>Molock</hi> of which he ſpeaks in that <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31. So when it's ſaid that they offer'd ſtrange fire <hi>which the Lord commanded not, Lev.</hi> 10.1. all conclude that leſs is ſaid and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord hath forbidden it. Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> himſelf cannot deny it, who yet makes the ſame uſe of this phraſe ſometimes that this Author doth. And indeed a man muſt flatly contradict all reaſon that oppoſes this. For when he ſpeaks of thoſe that ſhould worſhip other Gods. Sun and Moon <hi>which he had not commanded, Deut.</hi> 17.3. it is ſenceleſs to interpret it otherwiſe than this; <hi>which he had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> For if this was the reaſon why a man ſinned in worſhipping the Moon, that he did it without Gods leave or Command; it would ſuppoſe that God might have commanded them to worſhip it and ſerve other Gods: which no body imagines. All thoſe places therefore, which he alledges to prove that Gods not commanding a thing is enough to make it unlawful, amount to no more but <hi>this;</hi> that his forbidding a thing makes it unlawful.</p>

If this Reaſoning be good, then this is I am ſure. God directed every thing about their Sacrifices in the <hi>Jewiſh Law,</hi> and therefore no Rite or Ceremony was to be added by them, becauſe if any more were needful they might ſtill repair to him: But he hath not done ſo under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> nor do we know to what Prophet or Oracle to go for direction in every thing; and therefore we muſt repair to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prudence and diſcretion.</p>

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body knows <hi>Cartwright, Reynolds, Greenham</hi> were of this opinion as the Prefacer boldly told you; and it is a wonder he did not add Dr. <hi>Sibbs.</hi> For ſo ſome of your party took care the world ſhould believe; and choſe rather to corrupt his writings, then have it thought he was of another Perſwaſion.</p>

               <p>You may chuſe: But I ſhall prove that this good mans writings were abuſed preſently after his death in this very point. For in his Book called the <hi>Souls Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,</hi> he gave this direction among others to guide a Soul in doubtful Caſes. <hi>The Laws under which we live are particular determinations of the Law of God; and therefore ought to be a rule to us ſo far as they reach. Though it be too narrow a Rule to be good only ſo far as mans Law guides unto; yet Law being the joynt Reaſon and conſent of many men for publick Good, hath an uſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63803:119"/>for the guiding of our Actions that are under the ſame. VVhere it daſhes not againſt Gods Law; what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Law is agreeable to Conſcience.</hi> Thus the Rule ſtood when the Book firſt came out<note n="*" place="margin">Firſt Edition 1635. pag. 364.</note>. But in a very ſhort time after, when he was newly laid in his grave, the firſt words were changed into theſe; <hi>The Laws under which we live, are particular determinations of the Law of God in ſome duties of the Second Table.</hi> In which they made two reſtrictions of that which he had ſaid in General words; Firſt, they reſtrain'd the Rule to the <hi>Second Table,</hi> and not to all things neither, but only <hi>ſome duties.</hi> And then they add a whole Sentence, by way <hi>of Example,</hi> which was not in the firſt Edition: which I make no doubt was done on purpoſe, leſt any man who read the Book ſhould think it was the <hi>Doctors</hi> opinion, that we ſhould conform to the Orders of our Governours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the worſhip of God, where the Law of God hath determined nothing in particular, and their Laws do not croſs his. But what is there done by the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> worſe than this! what greater injury to the dead than thus to play tricks with their Books, and change their words at your pleaſure?</p>

He is Anſwering I told you this Queſtion, what courſe muſt we take for guidance of our lives in particular actions wherein Doubts may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, what is moſt agreeable to Gods will? And one Advice is this; <hi>we muſt look to our place wherein God hath ſet us. If we be in ſubjection to others, their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in doubtful things ought to ſway with us.</hi> A dangerous Rule ſome men thought; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63803:119"/>in the next Edition, they left out thoſe words <hi>in doubtful things.</hi> And alſo blotted out this whole ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which follows; <hi>It is certain we ought to obey</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in doubtful things of which he is ſpeaking) <hi>and if the things wherein we are to obey be certain to us; we ought to leave that which is uncertain, and ſtick to that which is certain: In this caſe we muſt obey thoſe that are under God.</hi>

For which he there gives ſolid Reaſons. And whatſoever is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the contrary, the Reformed Churches do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Counſel; and tye men to a Form in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick duties of Gods worſhip, as I can evidently ſhew. But now let me only obſerve that heretofore your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters thought it no light Argument againſt the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts,</hi> that all <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> acknowledged the

                  <hi>Church of England</hi> as their ſiſter: and conſequently did not think her wicked for impoſing Forms of Prayer. So you may read in the Book I told you of before, publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Rathband,</hi> p. 6. though the truth is thoſe Miniſters have taken that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the Book of Mr. <hi>Bernards</hi>

For even Saint</hi> Paul <hi>who received not his calling either from or by men, alledges for the credit of his Miniſtry, that three chief Apoſtles approved him, and gave him the right hand of fellowſhip.

Even the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> allowed impoſitions in ſome caſes. For they propound this as an expedient, that, if it ſhall appear any Miniſter proves inſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duty of prayer in a conceived way, it may be <hi>impoſed on him</hi> as a puniſhment <hi>to uſe a ſet form and no other</hi>

                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:63803:121"/>which you now complain of.

               <p>Do you ſo? That's becauſe you deſpiſe it, and think it good for little or nothing. But were there one of your own Inventions to be eſtabliſhed, you would never leave us at Liberty, if you had power, to make uſe of it or let it alone. Nothing ſhould ſtand in competition with it: but every thing elſe, as well as Common-Prayer, fall before it, as <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark. Did not the <hi>Independents</hi> incur your diſpleaſure for craving an allowance to order a few Churches after their own faſhion?

               <p>The ſame whereby they would proceed now; if they had the ſame power and the ſame hopes.

For they have invented, you muſt know, a Model and form of their own heads which is not appointed in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures.

And then it is held (at leaſt by many) that the Members muſt <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, i. e.</hi> exerciſe their gifts in and before the whole Congregation, by preaching, expounding, applying the Scripture: by inſtruction, confutation, Reprehenſion with all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<note n="†" place="margin">Which they ſay is an Ordinance perpetual in the Church as we read in Mr. Cottons Catechiſm.</note> Now having deviſed theſe things, to name no more, I obſerve that the <hi>Covenant</hi> in the ſame Church is in one and the <hi>ſame Form</hi> of words, as well as matter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put into <hi>writing;</hi> and muſt be <hi>read</hi> by the party to be admitted, or he muſt hear it read by ſome other and give his Aſſent to it.

I find alſo that by this Covenant, the Members in ſome places<note n="†" place="margin">Church of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in New-Engl.</note> were <hi>reſtrained and tyed up</hi> from ſhewing their gifts in <hi>ſpeaking</hi> or <hi>ſcrupling;</hi> till they were called thereto; that is, they being allowed to propheſie publickly, and ſo to propound queſtions and make objections (which they call <hi>Scrupling</hi>) they bound them up in this <hi>Covenant,</hi> which had the force of Law, from doing it uncall'd. I would fain know whether this be not to limit the Spirit (as you ſpeak) and to ſtint it to <hi>times,</hi> as you ſay we do it to <hi>words?</hi> For if a man be never ſo full, he muſt have no vent without a call from the Church. And how I pray you doth this differ from an Eccleſiaſtical Canon, as to it's force and obligation; but only that it hath another name; and all old <hi>Canons</hi> muſt be lay'd aſide, to make way for this new Covenant.

                  <q>Firſt, maintain and uphold all that is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly good in it. 2. If there be any manifeſt evils, labour in your place by the beſt means to have them amended peaceably. 3. Bear with lighter faults for a time till a fit occaſion be offered to have them amended. 4. As for likelihoods of evil make them not apparent evil by ill interpretation; where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the State intends it, nor ſo maintains it. 5. Take doubtful things ever in the better part. 6. Judiciouſly diſcern between the abuſe of a thing and that which may be well uſed: leſt in abhorring the <hi>abuſe,</hi> thou alſo do utterly condemn the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf and the <hi>uſe</hi> thereof. 7. Let not the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition (as thou fancieſt it) of any Forain Church or State, make thee unthankful for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good thou enjoyeſt at home, and loath thine own happineſs. 8. Mark and hold the difference between theſe things; the Equity of Law and the Execution; the truth Generally eſtabliſhed and profeſſed, and the perſonal Errors of ſome. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſoundneſs of Doctrine and bad Application; between ſubſtance and circumſtance; between the very being of a thing, and the well being of it; between what is neceſſary and what is only conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and deſirable; between a Commandment and a Commandment to thee; between what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and what is expedient. 9. Never preſume to reform others, before thou haſt well ordered thy ſelf. 10. Do not diſobey the evident command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: and when there is nothing but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſinning in obeying the precept of thy Governors, do not ſet opinion before judgment. Set aſide fancy, and do not refuſe to obey Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where it is not <hi>plain</hi> thou ſhalt ſin againſt God.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63803:129"/>Be more loth to offend a lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ☞ than many private perſons. Where thou canſt not yield, there humbly crave pardon. Where thou canſt not be tollerated, be contented with Correction for ſafety of Conſcience: and bear what thou canſt not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, with a patient mind. Remember that to ſtand more upon avoiding diſlike in private perſons, than in offending the publick authority, ☞ is no better than an humouring of men to increaſe diſcontentedneſs, rather than to preſerve the publick peace and welfare. Nay, it is better to croſs ſome mens affections with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin to God, than to neglect moſt certain Duty, let people periſh, open a gap to the enemy, loſe thy liberty, and no whit better the Church of God.</q>

               <p>In this caſe he hath given you ſuch good Directions that I need ſeek for no other. <q>The ſubſtance of them is this. You would do well to examine your ſelf whence your Doubt ariſes, whether from ſerious conſideration and a judgment convinced; or that it be only a nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſlike, coming from a deſire not to be troubled with them, or for that thou haſt not been uſed to them, or becauſe ſome cannot away with them, or from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and want of knowledge, or perhaps from a godly jealouſie and fear of doing amiſs (I may add from a natural timorouſneſs and uncertainty of mind which can reſolve nothing.) If the ground be not a judgment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned and convinced, it is not trouble of conſcience, but a diſlike that works diſcontentedneſs upon ſome of the former grounds; which muſt be removed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and ſetling your judgment upon the Word of God and ſound Reaſon. Nay, it will be fit to conſider, whether this doubting do not ariſe through your own default, by looking out Reaſons to increaſe your diſlike, and neglecting to ſearch for Arguments ☜ to give you ſatisfaction. If this be your Caſe, as it is certain it is of too many, take as great pains to reſolve your ſelf as you have done to bring your ſelf into doubting; elſe you deal but <hi>partially.</hi> And have a care you be not too highly conceited of your ſelf, and look upon your own reaſons through the vapour of affection.</q>

               <p>Examine well without prejudice what our Divines have replyed an hundred times to this, and you will find it an abſurd Principle. Or for the preſent onely weigh what he ſaith, <q>Why ſhould a man be more ſcrupulous
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63803:130"/>to ſeek to have a plain command for every thing he doth in Eccleſiaſtical matters, even about things in themſelves indifferent, than about matters politick in Civil affairs? Men in theſe matters knwo not the ground nor end of many things which they yield unto, upon a General command to obey Authority; and knowing them not to be directly againſt God's will. And yet our obedience in all Civil matters muſt be <hi>firſt</hi> of Conſcience, and, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> as ſerving the Lord; which cannot be without knowledge and perſwaſion that we do well even <hi>in that particular</hi> in which we obey: which men uſually for conſcience ſake inquire not into, but reſt themſelves <hi>with a General command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> obeying lawful Authority, ſo it be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a plain commandment of God. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth let, but that a man may ſo ſatisfie himſelf in matters Eccleſiaſtical? I muſt tell you ("ſaith ☞ he) that the curious ſearching ſo <hi>particularly</hi> into every thing to have full ſatisfaction, hath ſo wrought in theſe days upon mens wits to bring di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions; that the more men ſeek in doubt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, the further they are from it.</q>

Avoid that which is plainly forbidden, or follows neceſſarily by an <hi>immediate</hi> conſequence. 5. Follow true Antiquity and the General practice of the Church of God in all ages, where they have not erred from the evident Truth of God. 6. If thou
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:63803:130"/>ſuffereſt (ſaith he) let it be for known Truth and againſt known wickedneſs; for which thou haſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Gods word, or of the holy Martyrs in Church ſtory: But beware of <hi>far fetcht conſequences,</hi> or of ſuffering for new devices, and for things formerly unto all Ages unknown, ſeem they never ſo holy and juſt unto man.</q>

Such are the things the Apoſtle ſpeaks off; forbearing the uſe of our Liberty in eating fleſh, or the like caſe. If a man doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may do that, or whether he may play at Tables or Cards; the omiſſion here being no more but only denying our ſelves a little content, the doubt ſhould make a man forbear.

Authority will rule thus and ſo, Subjects will obey with Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Judgment from the word is not ſo much a Guide, as will and affection in too many are made Maſters.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63803:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>any coherence: which would never trouble me at all (you may think and ſpeak as you pleaſe) if you were not ſo conceited of your ſelves, as if you were the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, that muſt give Law and Religion to all others.</p>

               <p>No doubt of it. Let them therefore endeavour to mend the reſt. And remember them of ſuch paſſages as theſe in your Books, which once they allowed of. <hi>No man endowed with right Reaſon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Alarm by way of Anſwer to the laſt warning piece, p. 15.

                  <hi>but will ſay there is a neceſſity of a Government: if of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, then of an Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, elſe it will be confuſed.

And no man that hath any uſe of Conſcience in any thing but will acknowledge he is bound in Conſcience to obey the Laws of the Land in which he lives, in all indifferent things: Or he is turbulent and deſerves cenſure, even for matters concerning Worſhip. He that hath the uſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will make Conſcience of the duties of both Tables, as well as one. There is doubtleſs a Conſcience towards God, and a Conſcience towards man: This was the Apoſtles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and muſt be our Rule.</hi> Act. 24.16. <hi>I exerciſe my ſelf to have alwayes a Conſcience void of offence, toward God and toward men.</hi> Once more Farewel.</p>
